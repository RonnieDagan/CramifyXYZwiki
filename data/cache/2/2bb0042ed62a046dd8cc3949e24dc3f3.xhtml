History
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> John Locke and empiricism</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Philosopher who extended Descartes’s application of natural laws to all things: believing that even the mind is under the control of such laws</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Descarte: Fluid in the brain flows through nerves, causing movement so reflexes aren’t controlled</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Locke’s school of thought is known as empiricism</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The view that knowledge comes from experience via the senses, and science flourishes through observation and experiment</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The roots of psychology can be traced back to the philosophy of Empiricism: emphasizing the role of experience and evidence, especially sensory perception, in the formation of ideas, while discounting the notion of innate ideas</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In his book, Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke proposed that humans are born knowing nothing; Locke used the term tabula rasa (Latin for “blank slate”) to describe the mind of an infant</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Locke felt that all knowledge must derive from experience</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Locke emphasized nurture over nature as the greater influence on development</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Thomas Hobbes and behaviorism</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) believed that the idea of a soul or spirit, or even of a mind, is meaningless</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Hobbes’s philosophy is known as materialism, which is the belief that the only things that exist are matter and energy and what we experience as consciousness is simply a by-product of the machinery of the brain</div>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Hobbes greatly influenced behaviorism</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The view that psychology should be an objective science that studies behavior without reference to mental processes</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> This learning theory states that behaviors are learned from the environment, and says that innate or inherited factors have very little influence on behavior</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Charles Darwin and evolutionary theory</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In On the Origin of Species (1859), Charles Darwin (1809–1882) proposed a theory of natural selection, according to which all creatures have evolved into their present state over long periods of time</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This evolution occurs because there exists naturally occurring variation among individuals in a species, and the individuals that are best adapted to the environment are more likely to survive and then reproduce—and are likely to produce more successful offspring</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Evolutionary theory affected psychology by providing a way to explain differences between species and justifying the use of animals as a means to study the roots of human behavior</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Behavior evolves just like physiology: both function to help individuals survive</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Edward Titchener and introspection</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Edward Titchener (1867–1927) was a student in Wundt’s laboratory and was one of the first to bring the science of psychology to the United States</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Titchener sought to identify the smallest possible elements of the mind, theorizing that understanding all of the parts would lead to the understanding of the greater structure of the mind</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Which are illuminated through interviews with a subject describing his or her conscious experience, this is known as introspection</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Introspection is just looking within oneself to explore the elemental structure of the human mind</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Wilhelm Wundt and structuralism</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Many credit Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) as the founder of the science of psychology.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Wundt was trained in physiology and hoped to apply the methods that he used to study the body to the study of the mind</div>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Structuralism was founded by Wilhelm Wundt, who used controlled methods, such as introspection, to break down consciousness to its basic elements without sacrificing any of the properties of the whole</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Structuralism was the approach and introspection was the methodology</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Structuralism entails looking for patterns in thought</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> William James and functionalism</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> William James (1842–1910), an American psychologist, opposed the structuralist approach</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Examined how the structures identified by Wundt function in our lives</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Structures of consciousness must have a function such as smelling and thinking</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Argued that what is important is the function of the mind, such as how to solve a complex problem</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> James, influenced by Darwin, believed that the important thing to understand is how the mind fulfills its purpose</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This function-oriented approach is appropriately called functionalism</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Mary Whiton Calkins, Dorothea Dix, G. Stanley Hall, Margaret Floy Washburn</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Mary Whiton Calkins: first female graduate student in psychology, but she was denied a PhD because of her gender; she outscored all of the male students in her qualifying exams</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Dorothea Dix: reformed mental institutions in the U.S.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> G. Stanley Hall: first president the American Psychological Association, formed in 1892</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Margaret Floy Washburn: first female PhD in psychology and served as the second female president of the American Psychological Association</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Approaches
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Behavioral genetics</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Behavioral genetics is the field of psychology that explores how particular behaviors may be attributed to genetics</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This perspective takes into account biological predispositions as well as the extent of influence that the environment had</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> A person studying behavioral genetics might investigate to what extent risk-taking behavior in adolescents is attributable to genetics</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Behaviorism</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Behaviorism posits that psychology is the study of observable behavior and that the mind or mental events are unimportant as they cannot be observed</div>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Classical conditioning, first identified by Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936), was one of the behaviorists’ most important early findings; it is defined as a form of learning in which learning in which a behavior comes to be elicited by a formerly neutral stimulus</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> John Watson (1878–1958) and his assistant Rosalie Rayner applied classical conditioning to humans in the famed Little Albert experiment: they made loud sounds behind a 9-month-old whenever he would touch something white and furry, and he was afraid of everything white and furry afterwards</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> B. F. Skinner (1904–1990), through the development of Skinner Box, described operant conditioning, in which a subject learns to associate a behavior with an environmental outcome</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> A Skinner box is a device used to record an animal&#039;s behavior in a compressed time frame in which it will be rewarded or punished for engaging in certain behaviors</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Behaviorism no longer prevailing approach in psychology but behavioral principles still used in behavior modification: techniques in which psychological problems are considered to be the product of learned habits and can be unlearned by using behavioral methods</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Biological</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> View genes, chemicals and body types as the determinant of personality</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Genetics play a role in temperament: emotional style and characteristics that define how a person deals with the world</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Biopsychosocial</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Emphasizes the need to investigate the interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors as contributing to a behavior or a mental process</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Cognitive/cognitive-behavioral</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Cognitive psychology is an approach rooted in the idea that to understand people’s behavior, we must first understand how they think</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Cognitive psychology concerns itself with thinking, memory, and internal thought processes</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This approach combines the structuralist approach of looking at the subcomponents of thought and functionalist approach of understanding the purpose of thought</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Replaced the purely behavioral approach as the predominant psychological method used in U.S.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Evolutionary</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The study of behaviors and mental processes that are inherited from ancestors and how the principles natural selection and genes present</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Draws from Darwinian theories of natural selection and evolution</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> For example, fear is an adaptive evolutionary response and without fear our survival would be jeopardized</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Gestalt</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> School of thought that looks at the human mind and behavior as a whole</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Core belief is <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-holism-4685432" class="urlextern" target="_blank" title="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-holism-4685432" rel="ugc nofollow noopener">holism</a>, or that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> When trying to make sense of the world around us, we do not simply focus on every small component; instead, our minds tend to perceive objects as part of a greater whole and as elements of more complex systems</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Humanistic</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Humanistic approach is rooted in the philosophical tradition of studying the roles of consciousness, free will, and awareness of the human condition</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Humanistic psychologists emphasize personal values and goals and how they influence behavior</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) proposed the idea of self-actualization: we have a hierarchy of needs; you can’t achieve the top level, self actualization, unless the previous levels have been achieved because lower needs dominate an individual’s motivation as long as they are unsatisfied; from bottom to top the levels are physiological needs, safety, belonging, self-esteem, self-actualization</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Carl Rogers (1902–1987) believed in unconditional positive regard: people will naturally strive for self actualization and high self-esteem, unless society taints them</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Psychodynamic/psychoanalytic</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Developed by Freud (1856–1939) who believed that the id, superego and ego, fought for dominance in an individual’s unconscious and thus compose their personality</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Id (instincts): the primitive and instinctual part of the mind that contains sexual and aggressive drives and hidden memories; exists in the unconscious mind</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Ego (reality): reality principle/negotiator between desires of the id and limitations of the environment; mediate between id and superego; exists in party conscious and partly unconscious</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Superego (morality): control the id&#039;s impulses, especially those which society forbids, such as sex and aggression and persuades the ego to turn to moralistic goals rather than realistic ones and to strive for perfection; operates on conscious and unconscious level</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Believed innate drives for sex and aggression are the primary motives for our behavior and personalities</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Sociocultural</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Belief that the environment a person lives in has a great deal to do with how the person behaves and how others perceive that behavior</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Cultural values vary from society to society and must be taken into account if one wishes to understand, predict, or control behavior</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Unintentional sampling bias occurred during the 1948 U.S. Presidential Election: a survey was conducted by randomly calling households and asking them whom they intended to vote for, Harry Truman or Thomas Dewey, and based on this phone survey, Dewey was projected to win but the results of the election proved otherwise, as Truman was re-elected</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> In 1948, having a telephone was not such a common thing, and households that had them were generally wealthier; as a result, the “random” selection of telephone numbers was not a representative sample because many people did not have telephone numbers</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Types of sampling bias</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> The bias of selection from a specific real area occurs when people are selected in a physical space; for example, if you wanted to survey college students on whether or not they like their football team, you could stand on the quad and survey the first 100 people that walk by; however, this is not completely random because people who don’t have class at that time are unlikely to be represented</div>
</li>

</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> However, this does not tell the whole story: another theory, known as <strong>opponent process theory</strong>, contends that cells within the thalamus respond to opponent pairs of receptor sets—namely, black/white, red/green, and blue/yellow; if one color of the set is activated, the other is essentially turned off</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> For example, when you stare at a red dot on a page and then you turn away to a blank piece of white paper, you will see a green dot on the blank piece of paper because the red receptors have become fatigued and, in comparison, the green receptors are now more active: this is known as an afterimage</div>

Operant conditioning
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Operant conditioning (also called instrumental conditioning) involves an organism’s learning to make a response in order to obtain a reward or avoid punishment</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Biological constraints</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Reinforcement (think reward) and punishment</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Food is a form of natural reinforcement; natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sex, provide primary reinforcement: they don’t have to be learned to be liked</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Secondary reinforcement is provided by learned reinforcers; Money is a good example of a secondary reinforcer; in nature, money is just paper or metal; it has no intrinsic value</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Punishment is also an important element of operant conditioning, but the effect is the opposite: reinforcement increases behavior, while punishment decreases it</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Punishment is the process by which a behavior is followed by a consequence that decreases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Reinforcement is a better alternative to encourage behavioral changes and learning</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Positive vs. negative</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Positive reinforcement or punishment adds (giving money vs giving chores)</div>

</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Schedules</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Behaviorists use various schedules of reinforcement in their experiments</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Continuous reinforcement schedule</strong>: every correct response emitted results in a reward</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> This produces rapid learning, but it also results in rapid extinction, where extinction is a decrease and eventual disappearance of a response once the behavior is no longer reinforced</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Partial/intermittent reinforcement schedules</strong> is when not all responses are rewarded</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> A <strong>fixed-ratio schedule</strong> is one in which the reward always occurs after a fixed number of responses</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> For example, a rat might have to press a lever 10 times in order to receive a food pellet; this schedule is called a 10:1 ratio schedule</div>
</li>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> Fixed-ratio schedules produce strong learning, but the learning extinguishes relatively quickly</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> A <strong>variable-ratio schedule</strong> is one in which the ratio of responses to reinforcement is variable and unpredictable</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> A good example of this is slot machines: the response, putting in money and pulling the lever, is reinforced with a payoff in a seemingly random manner; reinforcement can come at any time</div>
</li>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> This type of schedule takes longer to condition a response; however, the learning that occurs is resistant to extinction</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> A <strong>fixed-interval schedule</strong> is one in which reinforcement is presented as a function of fixed periods of time, as long as there is at least one response</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> This schedule is similar to being a salaried employee: every two weeks, the paycheck arrives regardless of your work performance</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> In the <strong>variable-interval schedule</strong>, reinforcement is presented at differing time intervals, as long as there is at least one response</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> This schedule of reinforcement is illustrated by a teacher who gives pop quizzes: the time the quiz will be given is always changing</div>

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> To get the rats to learn to press a lever, the experimenter would use a procedure called shaping, in which a rat first receives a food reward for being near the lever, then for touching the lever, and finally for pressing the lever; at the end, the rat is rewarded only for pressing the lever</div>

Thorndike, who proposed the law of effect, which states that a behavior is more likely to recur if reinforced, Skinner ran many operant conditioning experiments: he often used a specially designed testing apparatus: an operant conditioning chamber, or a Skinner Box</div>

Other forms of learning
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Nonassociative</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Nonassociative learning occurs when an organism is repeatedly exposed to one type of stimulus</div>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Two important types of nonassociative learning are habituation and sensitization</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> A habit is an action that is repeatedly performed and habituation follows that same idea: essentially, a person learns to “tune out” the stimulus</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> For example, suppose you live near train tracks, and trains pass by your house on a regular basis, when you first move into the house, the sound of the trains passing by is annoying and loud, and it always makes you cover your ears; however, after living in the house for a few months, you become used to the sound and stop covering your ears and you may even become so accustomed to the sound that it becomes background noise, and you don’t even notice it</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> After a person has been habituated to a given stimulus, and the stimulus is removed, this leads to dishabituation—the person is no longer accustomed to the stimulus. If the stimulus is then presented again, the person will react to it as if it were a new stimulus</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> During sensitization, there is an increase in responsiveness due to either a repeated application of a stimulus or a particularly aversive or noxious stimulus: instead of being able to “tune out” or ignore the stimulus so as to avoid reacting at all (as in habituation), the stimulus actually produces a more exaggerated response</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Imagine you attend a rock concert and the feedback noise from the amplifier may at first be merely irritating, but as the aversive noise continues, instead of getting used to it, it actually becomes much more painful, to the point at which you have to cover your ears and perhaps even move</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Sensitization may also cause you to respond more vigorously to similar stimuli: for example, as you leave the rock concert, an ambulance passes, but the siren, which usually doesn’t bother you, seems particularly loud and abrasive, as you’ve been sensitized to the noise of the rock concert</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Sensitization is usually temporary and unlikely to result in any long-term change</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Desensitization is a decreased responsiveness to an aversive stimulus after repeated exposure; this may occur on its own or in desensitization therapy</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Second, disordered behavior is maladaptive: that is, it interferes with a person’s ability to function in a particular situation</div>
</li>

Categories of Disorders
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The term neurodevelopmental refers to the developing brain</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Related disorders manifest early in development, and may be due to genetic issues, trauma in the womb, or brain damage acquired at birth or in the first years of life</div>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> These disorders can range from very specific learning deficits to very global impairments to social skills or intelligence</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Intellectual disability (formerly known as mental retardation) is characterized by delayed development in general mental abilities</div>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that often manifests early on in childhood development</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> This may manifest itself in social communication deficits, both verbal and nonverbal, in which the individual has difficulty noticing social cues and has difficulty engaging others or in the form of restrictive or repetitive behaviors, difficulty coping with change, or difficulty with accepting change in activity</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is described as patterned inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Other neurodevelopmental disorders include communication disorders such as language disorder, speech sound disorder, and fluency disorder (stuttering); motor disorders such as developmental coordination disorder, stereotypic movement disorder, and tics; and specific learning disorders</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> These disorders are marked by disturbances in thought, perception and speech, as well as motor behavior and emotional experience</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Delusions are beliefs that are not based in reality, such as believing that one can fly, that one is the president of a country, or that one is being pursued by the CIA</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Hallucinations are perceptions that are not based in reality, such as seeing things or hearing voices that are not there, or feeling spiders on one’s skin</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Disorganized thinking and disorganized speech are typical: a person with such a disorder may switch from one topic to another in illogical fashion, may respond to questions with irrelevant answers, and may produce streams of speech that have little or no coherence</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and OCD</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Bipolar disorders, as the name suggests, involve movement between two poles: depressive states on the one hand, and manic states on the other hand</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Because manic states often have psychotic features, the DSM-5 now regards bipolar disorders as a bridge between the psychoses and the major depressive disorders</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Depressive disorders involve the presence of a sad, empty, or irritable mood, combined with changes in thinking and bodily functioning that significantly impair one’s ability to function</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Separate or combined treatments such as psychotherapy (in particular cognitive-behavioral therapy) and antidepressant medications may assist in recovery</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> In a state of anxiety, the nervous system wants to get into fight-or-flight mode, but there is nothing there to fight and nothing to flee from</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Physical effects of anxiety may include but are not limited to muscle tension, hyperalertness for danger signs, and avoidance behaviors</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Sleep disturbances, irritability, and inability to concentrate are common related symptoms</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurring panic attacks, as well as the constant worry of another panic attack occurring</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by an almost constant state of autonomic nervous system arousal and feelings of dread and worry</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Phobias, or persistent, irrational fears of common events or objects, are also anxiety disorders</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> OCD is characterized by involuntary, persistent thoughts or obsessions, as well as compulsions, or repetitive behaviors that are time consuming and maladaptive, that an individual believes will prevent a particular (usually unrelated) outcome</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Related disorders include body dysmorphic disorder and hoarding disorder, which involve obsessive thoughts about bodily defects or the need to save possessions</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Some specific disorders involve hair-pulling and skin-picking</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Trauma- and stressor-related disorders</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> These disorders follow a particularly disturbing event or set of events (the trauma or the stressor)</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can involve intrusive thoughts or dreams related to the trauma, irritability, avoidance of situations that might recall the traumatic event, sleep disturbances, diminished interest in formerly pleasurable activities, and social withdrawal</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Other disorders include reactive attachment disorder, which can occur in seriously neglected children who are unable to form attachments to their adult caregivers, and adjustment disorders, or maladaptive responses to particular stressors</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Dissociative and somatic symptom disorders</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> In many cases, these disorders appear following a trauma, and may be seen as the mind’s attempt to protect itself by splitting itself into parts</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> One might experience derealization, the sense that “this is not really happening”</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Depersonalization, the sense that “this is not happening to me”</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Significant gaps in memory may be related to dissociative amnesia, an inability to recall life events that goes far beyond normal forgetting</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Perhaps the most extreme of these disorders is dissociative identity disorder, in which one may not only “lose time,” but also manifest a separate personality during that lost time</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Somatic symptom disorder involves bodily symptoms combined with disordered thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviors connected to these symptoms</div>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> It is not the symptoms themselves, but how the individual experiences them, that is striking and seems maladaptive: the level of worry seems out of proportion to the symptom itself</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Related worries appear in illness anxiety disorder, in which one worries excessively about the possibility of falling ill.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Conversion disorder involves bodily symptoms like changed motor function or changed sensory function that are incompatible with neurological explanations</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> There may be a suspicion that the symptoms are psychogenic (created by the mind) however, a symptom can originate from the mind but end up in the body</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> There is also factitious disorder, in which an individual knowingly falsifies symptoms in order to get medical care, or sympathy or aid from others</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Feeding and eating disorders, substance and addictive disorders</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Anorexia nervosa (commonly called anorexia) involves not only restriction of food intake, but also intense fear of gaining weight and disturbances in self-perception, such as thinking one looks fat, when one does not</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The self-starvation behavior associated with this disorder can lead to life-threatening medical conditions</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Bulimia nervosa (commonly called bulimia) involves recurrent episodes of binge-eating: eating large amounts of food in short amounts of time, followed by inappropriate behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting (purging), using laxatives, or intense exercising</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> There is usually a heightened sense of shame in connection with both binging and purging</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Binge-eating disorder might be thought of as bulimia without purging; this occurs in both normal-weight and overweight/obese people</div>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Pica refers to regular consumption of non-nutritive substances (plastic, paper, dirt, string, etc.)</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> This occurs more often in children, but can occur in adults, and is occasionally seen in pregnant women and individuals with iron deficiency</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Personality disorders</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> A personality disorder refers to a stable (and inflexible) way of experiencing and acting in the world, one that is at variance with the person’s culture, that starts in adolescence or adulthood, and leads to either personal distress or impairment of social functioning</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> It is important to note that children cannot have personality disorders; think of it this way: children are still developing their personalities</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders: these individuals appear to be markedly odd or eccentric</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> With paranoid personality disorder, there may be a pattern of general distrust of others that is not justified by real circumstances</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Schizoid personality disorder is marked by disturbances in feeling (detachment from social relationships, flat affect, does not enjoy close relationships with people)</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Schizotypal personality disorder is marked by disturbances in thought (odd beliefs that do not quite qualify as delusions, such as superstitions, belief in a “sixth sense,” etc.; odd speech; eccentric behavior or appearance)</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Cluster B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Antisocial personality disorder, which is characterized by a persistent pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others: lying, cheating, stealing, and having no remorse are common</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Borderline personality disorder involves a very stormy relationship with the world, with others, and with one’s own feelings: people with this disorder have a regular pattern of instability in relationships, often involving frantic efforts to avoid abandonment (imagined or real), alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation with the same person, identity disturbance, impulsivity, chronic feelings of emptiness, and anger</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Histrionic personality disorder involves a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking, beyond what might be considered normal</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Narcissistic personality disorder involves an overinflated sense of self-importance, fantasies of success, beliefs that one is special, a sense of entitlement, a lack of empathy for others, and a display of arrogant behaviors or attitudes</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Cluster C includes avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Avoidant personality disorder involves an enduring pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to real or perceived criticism, which lead to avoidance behavior in relation to social, personal, and intimate relationships</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Dependent personality disorder is marked by an excessive need to be cared for, leading to clingy and submissive behavior and fears of separation; people with this disorder may feel unable to make everyday decisions without constantly consulting others and getting their advice and approval</div>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is marked by a rigid concern with order, perfectionism, control, and work, at the expense of flexibility, spontaneity, openness, and play</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> In distinction to OCD, which involves unwanted or intrusive thoughts along with unwanted or intrusive compulsions, OCPD can involve similar thoughts and compulsions, but they are not seen by the person as intrusive; rather, the person with OCPD may think that the problem lies with other people, who do not see the need for things to be ordered in a certain way</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Usually, people do not seek treatment for their personality disorders, but, if their disorder leads them to become depressed or anxious, due to social or occupational impairments, they may seek help for depression or anxiety, and may become diagnosed in that way</div>
</li>
</ul>

General perspectives and issues
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> DSM-5</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is the American Psychiatric Association’s handbook for the identification and classification of behavioral disorders</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> DSM-5 calls for the separate notation of important social factors and physical disabilities, in addition to the diagnosis of mental disorder</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Etiology of disorders</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Freud and the psychoanalytic school hypothesized that the interactions among conscious and especially unconscious parts of the mind were responsible for a great deal of disordered behavior</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The humanistic school of psychology suggests that disordered behavior is, in part, a result of people being too sensitive to the criticisms and judgments of others</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The cognitive perspective views disordered behavior as the result of faulty or illogical thoughts</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The behavioral approach to disordered behavior is based on the notion that all behavior, including disordered behavior, is learned</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The biological view of disordered behavior views disordered behavior as a manifestation of abnormal brain function, due to either structural or chemical abnormalities in the brain</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The sociocultural approach holds that society and culture help define what is acceptable behavior</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Negative consequences of diagnostic labels (Rosenhan study)</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The Rosenhan experiment or Thud experiment was an experiment conducted to determine the validity of psychiatric diagnosis: the participants feigned hallucinations to enter psychiatric hospitals but acted normally afterwards and they were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and were given antipsychotic medication</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Rosenhan&#039;s study demonstrated that normal people often cannot be distinguished from the mentally ill in a hospital setting; according to Rosenhan, this is because of the overwhelming influence of the psychiatric-hospital setting on the staff&#039;s judgment of the individual&#039;s behavior</div>

Treatment
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Biological perspective of treatment</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Biological therapies are medical approaches to behavioral problems</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Biological therapies are typically used in conjunction with another form of treatment</div>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</strong> is a form of treatment in which fairly high voltages of electricity are passed across a patient’s head</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> This treatment causes temporary amnesia and can result in seizures</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> It has been successful in the treatment of major depression, but today it is used only when all other means have failed because of the risks involved with memory loss</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Another form of biological treatment is <strong>psychosurgery</strong></div>
<ul>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> The most well-known form is the prefrontal lobotomy, in which parts of the frontal lobes are cut off from the rest of the brain</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> This surgery was a popular treatment for violent patients from the 1930s–1950s</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> It frequently left patients in a zombie-like or catatonic state: its use marked a controversial chapter in the history of psychotherapy</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Psychopharmacology</strong> is the treatment of psychological and behavioral maladaptations with drugs</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> There are four broad classes of psychotropic, or psychologically active drugs: antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and lithium salts</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> Antipsychotics like Clozapine, Thorazine, and Haldol reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the neural receptors for dopamine</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> Jerky movements, tremors, and muscle stiffness are among the side effects of these drugs: the clinician must decide which is worse—the psychological disorder being treated or the side effects of the drugs</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> Antidepressants can be grouped into three types: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclics, and selective reuptake</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5 node"><div class="li"> <strong>MAO inhibitors</strong>, like Eutron, work by increasing the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft by blocking monoamine oxidase, which is responsible for the breakdown of many neurotransmitters</div>
<ul>
<li class="level6"><div class="li"> These drugs are effective but toxic and require special diets</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> <strong>Tricyclics</strong>, like Norpramin, Amitriptyline, and Imipramine, increase the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine</div>
</li>
<li class="level5 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Selective reuptake inhibitors</strong> (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs) increase the amount of neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft, by blocking the reuptake mechanism of the cell that released the neurotransmitters: Prozac (Fluoxetine) is one example of such a drug</div>
<ul>
<li class="level6"><div class="li"> The indirect mechanism of action of these drugs means that they have fewer side effects and are the most frequently prescribed class of antidepressant drugs in the United States</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Anxiolytics</strong> depress the central nervous system and reduce anxiety while increasing feelings of well-being and reducing insomnia: a commonly prescribed anti-anxiety medication is Xanax</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> Anxiolytics also include barbiturates, which are rarely used because of their potential for addiction and danger when mixed with other drugs</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> <strong>Lithium carbonate</strong> treats bipolar disorder (mechanism of action is unknown)</div>
</li>

<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Biopsychosocial perspective of treatment</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Biopsychosocial model helps primary care doctors to understand interactions among biological and psychosocial components of illnesses to improve the dyadic relationship between clinicians and their patients and multidisciplinary approaches in patient care</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Psychological perspectives of treatment</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Behavioral (Mary Cover Jones, Joseph Wolpe)</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Cover Jones was best able to reduce Peter&#039;s fear of rabbits through what she called direct conditioning a method similar to what’s known today as systematic desensitization</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Wolpe is most well known for his reciprocal inhibition techniques: reciprocal inhibition refers to the complete or partial suppression of anxiety responses as a consequence of the immediate evocation of other responses</div>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Behavioral therapy stands in dramatic contrast to the insight therapies</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> First, behavioral therapy is a short-term process, whereas the insight approaches are extended over long periods of time, often spanning years</div>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> Secondly, behavior treats symptoms because, in this school of thought, there is no deep underlying cause of the problem</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> The disordered behavior itself is both the problem and symptom</div>
</li>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> To change behavior, behavioral therapists use specific techniques with defined methods of application and clear ways to evaluate their efficacy</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Counterconditioning</strong> is a technique in which a response to a given stimulus is replaced by a different response</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> If a patient seeks behavioral therapy to stop drinking alcohol, the therapist must take the learned responses, the positive feelings generated by drinking alcohol, and replace them with a new reaction, negative feelings concerning alcohol</div>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> There are multiple methods of counterconditioning</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Aversion therapy</strong> is an aversive stimulus that is repeatedly paired with the behavior that the client wishes to stop</div>
<ul>
<li class="level6"><div class="li"> Therapist might administer a punishment to the patient each time the patient drinks alcohol</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level5 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Systematic desensitization i</strong>nvolves replacing one response, such as anxiety, with another response, such as relaxation</div>
<ul>
<li class="level6"><div class="li"> A variation can occur when a therapist introduces the client to increasingly more anxiety-inducing stimuli instead of relying solely on their imagination</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Another form of behavioral therapy are <strong>extinction procedures</strong>, which are designed to weaken maladaptive responses</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Flooding</strong> is exposing them to the stimulus that induces the undesirable response</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> If a client has come to a therapist to try to overcome a fear of spiders, the therapist will actually expose the client to spiders: the client will have high anxiety, but after a few minutes without any negative consequences, the client will realize that the situation is not dangerous</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> <strong>Implosion</strong> is a similar technique, in which the client imagines the disruptive stimuli rather than actually confronting them</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Behavioral contracting</strong> is when the therapist and the client draw up a contract by which they both agree to abide</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> The client must, according to the contract, act in certain ways and the therapist must provide stated rewards if the client holds up their end of the bargain</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Modeling</strong> is a therapeutic approach based on Bandura’s social learning theory. This technique is based on the principle of vicarious learning</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Clients watch someone act in a certain way and then receive a reward: presumably, the client will then be disposed to imitate that behavior</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Cognitive (Aaron Beck, Albert Ellis)</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Cognitive approaches to the treatment of disordered behavior rely on changing cognitions, or the ways people think about situations, in order to change behavior</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Rational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT)</strong> (sometimes called simply RET, for rational-emotive therapy), formulated by <strong>Albert Ellis</strong></div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> REBT is based on the idea that when confronted with situations, people recite statements to themselves that express maladaptive thoughts</div>
</li>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> The maladaptive thoughts result in maladaptive emotional responses</div>
</li>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> The goal of REBT is to change the maladaptive thoughts and emotional responses by confronting the irrational thoughts directly</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Cognitive therapy</strong>, by <strong>Aaron Beck</strong>, focuses on maladaptive schemas</div>

</li>
<li class="level5 node"><div class="li"> Dichotomous thinking: all-or-none conceptions of situations</div>

</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Differs from the Freudian approach in its focus on the client’s present perception of reality, rather than the past and its analysis of conscious, instead of unconscious, motives</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Not detached: therapist is open, honest, and expressive of feelings (active listener)</div>

<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The goal of the therapy is to help the client realize full potential through self-actualization</div>

<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Generally, such tension is not pleasant, and people tend to change in order to achieve cognitive consistency</div>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> Leon Festinger studied this phenomenon and came to the conclusion that people are likely to alter their attitude to fit their behavior</div>

<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Persuasion is the process by which a person or group can influence the attitudes of others</div>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> The efficacy of persuasion derives in part from the characteristics of the persuader</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> People who have positions of authority or who appear to be experts on a given topic are more likely to be viewed as persuasive</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> The motive of the persuader is also critical</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> If an author tries to convince you that authors are poor, and that you should donate five dollars to the poor authors’ fund, you would not believe the author</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Your disbelief would stem from your belief that the author’s motive is selfish</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> However, if an author asks for five dollars for disaster relief, you might be more likely to be persuaded because the motive seems more altruistic</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> An additional factor affecting persuasive ability is interpersonal attractiveness</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> More attractive, likeable, trustworthy, knowledgeable people are more persuasive</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Most people are also swayed by the presentation of facts</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Another factor influencing the persuasion process is the nature of the message</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Repetition is an effective technique for achieving persuasion, which is why the same advertisements run so frequently</div>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Fear is another motivator of attitudinal change</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> A prime example of the use of fear in persuasive attempts is the practice of putting cars wrecked in DWI (driving-while-intoxicated) accidents on display</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> The idea is that seeing the result of such an accident will induce an attitudinal change about drunk driving</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> The elaboration likelihood model explains when people will be persuaded by the content of a message (or the logic of its arguments), and when people will be influenced by other, more superficial characteristics like the length of the message, or the appearance of the person delivering it</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> The three key elements ar the message characteristics, source characteristics, and target characteristics</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5 node"><div class="li"> The message characteristics are the features of the message itself, such as its logic and the number of key points in the argument</div>
<ul>
<li class="level6"><div class="li"> Also includes more superficial things, such as the length and grammatical complexity</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level5 node"><div class="li"> The source characteristics of the person or group delivering the message, such as expertise, knowledge, and trustworthiness play an important role</div>
<ul>
<li class="level6"><div class="li"> People are much more likely to be persuaded by a major study described in the New England Journal of Medicine than by something in the pages of the local supermarket tabloid</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level5 node"><div class="li"> Target characteristics of the person receiving the message (such as self-esteem, intelligence, and mood) have an important influence on whether a message will be perceived as persuasive</div>

<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> If the subject was forced to sit in the room with the person receiving the shocks, his level of obedience dropped</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> The subject was also less likely to obey if the experimenter communicated the commands by phone instead of in person</div>
</li>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> Obedience also tended to go down if:</div>
<ul>
<li class="level5"><div class="li"> The subject was told that he was responsible for the outcome</div>
