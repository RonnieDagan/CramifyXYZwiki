<div class="level2">

<p>
The Spanish-American War
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Began from a struggle in Cuba for independence from Spain - there were 3 wars, and because of growing US business interests in Cuba, they intervened in the last war for independence</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> United States Interest in Cuba</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In the 1890s, an independence movement was trying to end Spanish rule - the governor, Valeriano Weyler, used cruel tactics (concentration camps) to suppress the rebellion</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> By 1898, ¼ of the population had died from starvation and disease</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Some American businessmen wanted to intervene because of the sugar harvest, and other citizens wanted to intervene because it was a struggle for independence, much like the US had experienced</div>

<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> “Yellow Journalism” and the Call to War</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Events in Cuba were brought to attention through newspapers</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Increased literacy set the groundwork for America’s first mass media, and to attract customers, newspapers began printing bold, sensational headlines, sometimes warping the truth</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> News organizations used these techniques to build support for war with Spain</div>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Sinking of the Maine</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The event that led directly to the Spanish-American war was the destruction of American battleship, the USS Maine, which blew up in Havana</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Although there was a lack of evidence that Spain caused this to happen, as a result of heightened tensions because of yellow journalism, many Americans pointed to Spain as the culprit</div>

<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> US Victory in the Spanish-American War</div>
<ul>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> American forces landed in Cuba on June 22, 1898, and Spanish forced surrendered on July 17</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Fighting in the Philippines lasted only days as they took the capital in an alliance with Filipino rebels</div>

<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Cuba and the Platt Amendment</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Cuba would become independent in name only - the US wanted to ensure that American economic interests would not be challenged by a future Cuban administration</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The Platt Amendment allowed the US to militarily intervene in Cuban affairs if it deemed necessary, limited the Cuban government’s ability to conduct foreign policy, and allowed the US to lease a naval base at Guantanamo Bay</div>

The United States as an Imperialism Power
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> The Insular Cases</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> As the US gained territories, the question of whether constitutional rights should be applied to people in new American territories led to heated debates</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Expansionists argued that residents of colonies should not expect citizenship or basic constitutional rights</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Anti-imperialists saw this as hypocrisy, that denying constitutional rights to people living under an American flag, would “put them into the rank of land-grabbing nations of Europe”</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> SCOTUS settled this in a series of cases known as the “Insular Cases”, and ruled that the imperial power need not grant its subjects constitutional rights, on the basis that the subjects were of an inferior race, and that the colonial power had the responsibility to uplift these people before granting them autonomy</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> War in the Philippines</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Many Filipinos were disappointed to learn that the US decided to hold on to the Philippines because they saw the US as a liberating force</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Following the Treaty of Paris, the three year long Philippine-American War ensued, far more deadly than the Spanish-American War</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Filipino forces were led by Emilio Aguinaldo and continued to resist for the next decade - but the US would hold onto the Philippines until WWII</div>

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Chirstian missionaries came to China, but found little success</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The presence of missionaries caused the creation of anti-foreign secret societies, such as the Boxers</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> He claimed that the US had the right to militarily intervene in the nations of Latin America - the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine</div>

</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Marcus Garvey was important in the black-nationalist movement because of his advocacy of black people returning to their ancestral homelands in Africa, and although not many people made this journey, this instilled pride in African Americans</div>

The Transition of the American Economy and Economic Instability
</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Panic = economic downturn</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> As the economy became more consolidated after the Civil War, with only a handful of corporations controlling larger and larger segment of the economy, if only a few of those companies experienced downturns, the potential for a large-scale disruption to the economy became more likely</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Panic of 1893 - worst economic depression before the Great Depression</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Caused by the bankruptcy of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, then the failure of the National Cordage Company</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This led to a major decline in stock prices, and led to a collapse of 500 banks, who invested their assets in the stock market</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This led to the subsequent collapse of 15,000 businesses, 20% of the workforce was unemployed and a million had lost their jobs in 1894</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The economy did not recover until 1901</div>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> The Panic of 1907</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Several banks had invested in a scheme to gain control of the United Copper Company</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> However, when the scheme was unraveled, a large number of bank customers withdrew their deposits simultaneously over concerns of the bank’s solvency (company’s ability to pay back long term debt and meet financial obligations) - bank runs</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> One major NY bank, Knickerbocker Trust Company, collapsed, sending ripples of fear through banks and leading to a withdrawal of reserves (cash minimums that banks must have on hand)</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This was partly calmed by J.P. Morgan, who offered to have US Steel take over a struggling steel industry rival that a major NY bank had invested in</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> However, the deal could not proceed until Morgan got assurances that Roosevelt and the government would not initiate antitrust action</div>

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The assembly line and scientific management vastly increased industrial output, and for much of the 1920s, the public was induced by easy credit and seductive advertising to absorb this increased output of goods</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> However, by 1927, consumption could not keep up with production</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> A weak labor movement led to stagnant wages, and ordinary Americans did not share in the economic expansion in the 1920s</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> By the late 1920s, manufacturers began laying off workers, worsening a bad situation</div>

<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Problems on the Farm</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> During this time, the agricultural sector lagged behind the rest of the economy</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Farmers increased production for WWI, but even afterwards, they were left in a cycle of debt, overproduction, and falling commodity prices</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This was worsened by mechanization, increased tariff rates, and an isolationist foreign policy</div>

</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> While this practice worked at first, it led to stock prices reaching new heights while the earnings of those corporations were declining, leading investors to sell stocks and incentivized panic selling</div>

<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Rugged Individualism and Limited Government Intervention</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Rather than expand federal intervention to address the Great Depression, Hoover invoked “rugged individualism” - the belief that the nation’s problems could best be solved by the people themselves, and when they were unable to, Hoover encouraged voluntary cooperation and private charities to step in</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> He started the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (1932), which extended loans to struggling railroads, banks, insurance companies, and other firms but not to individuals</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Truman issued the Truman Doctrine (1947) in which he said the goal of the US was to contain Communism</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The containment approach was spelled out in an article in Foreign Affairs “Sources of Soviet Conduct”, aka the “X Article”</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Later it was learned that George Kennan, a diplomat who had served in the US embassy in Moscow, wrote the article - however, he later reversed himself and recommended dialogue with the USSR</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This enclave, occupied by Allied troops after WWII, was cut off from the West within Communist-controlled East Germany</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The goal was for the USSR to cut off West Berlin’s food and supplies and make it part of East Germany</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Over the next year, Truman sent more than 278,000 flights to supply western Berlin - “Berlin Airlift” - prevented the USSR from taking over the city</div>

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The crisis over Berlin caused the US, Canada, and Western Europe to form a mutual defense pact</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> NATO was formed to resist any aggressive actions by the Soviet Union and created a standing army for this purpose</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This was the first time the US joined a formal peacetime alliance</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In response, the USSR formed an alliance with the COmmunist countries of Eastern Europe - the Warsaw Pact</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Blossomed in the 1950s; it challenged both the legal basis of segregation and the pervasive racism in society - the racism that had justified slavery and the persistence of Jim Crow segregation</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> A more receptive federal government gave support and backing to civil rights activism</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> It forced America to examine its most cherished institutions and reevaluate ingrained patterns of thought</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> At the same time, there was an intense backlash among whites in the South</div>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> WWII and the Origins of the Civil Rights Movement</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> WWII was a transformative experience for blacks - many returning soldiers who had taken part in the Double V campaign felt a sense of empowerment and engagement</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The injustices of American life seemed reprehensible to men who had just risked their lives serving their country</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In addition, the migration from rural to urban centers strengthened their appetite for change and justice</div>
</li>

<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-56)</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The catalyst for the boycott was Rosa Parks, an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who refused to give up her seat to a white person</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Although this was not the first time this had happened, civil rights leaders thought the time was right and used her as a public persona for the campaign against segregation</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The movement created the Montgomery Improvement Association to direct the campaign and selected MLK to head the organization</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The NAACP and its lead lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, thought the time was right to bring a key civil rights case to the court</div>

</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> There was evidence showing the psychological impact of segregation (Brandeis Brief)</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> SCOTUS ruled that the separate but equal doctrine of Plessy had to end, and that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal</div>

Challenges for the Civil Rights Movement

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> An example was in Little Rock, where authorities allowed 9 black students to enroll in Central High School</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Governor Faubus refused to cooperate, which led to mob action and violence outside the high school</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> He sent the National Guard to bar them from entering the school, and when this reached national news coverage, Eisenhower sent federal troops</div>

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Liberalism, called the “Great Society”, was the domestic agenda of LBJ; however, liberalism has deep roots and drew on a number of sources</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The liberal belief in the efficacy of government initiatives in addressing social problems can be traced back to the Progressive agenda as well as the New Deal</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Liberals sided with economist Keynes, who encouraged government expenditures to stimulate economic activity as well as to address broader social and economic goals</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> They sided with moderate labor leaders who had purged the labor movement of Communists and radicals after WWII</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In terms of foreign policy, liberalism was decidedly anti-Communist</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Although they condemned the excess of witch-hunting, they attempted to contain international Communism; and while some embraced Communism in the 30s, the violence of Stalinism pushed them toward an anti-Communist position</div>

<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Liberalism in the White House - From Kennedy to Johnson</div>

</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> His domestic agenda was called the “New Frontier” and are embodied in the Peace Corps, established to assist underdeveloped countries, with their volunteers working for 2 years as teachers, health workers, or advisors</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> He also created the Agency for International Development to coordinate aid to foreign countries, and the Alliance for Progress, a series of development projects in Latin America</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> LBJ passed a host of domestic programs that rivaled the New Deal, however, his administration’s reputation was ruined by a costly and unpopular war in Vietnam</div>

The Great Society Advances the Liberal Agenda
</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> A major goal of LBJ was to end poverty - Great Society programs developing Medicare and Medicaid, welfare programs, and public housing</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The Office of Economic Opportunity would oversee these programs, however, they had limited success because the cycle of poverty was too difficult to break in a short period of time</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The war in Vietnam also became increasingly costly, diverting billions of dollars</div>

</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Their situation was made worse by deregulation of the industry, and legislation widened their investment options, paving the way for riskier investments</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> By 1989, more than 700 S&amp;Ls had become insolvent, and HW Bush signed a bailout bill that extended billions of dollars to the industry</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This led to high unemployment, falling wages, and a housing crisis characterized by widespread foreclosures</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Many see the crisis in the housing market as an important cause of the Great Recession - in the 2000s, lending institutions devised new methods of borrowing money after the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, removing regulatory constraints on the banking industry</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Banks lured first time home buyers to take out mortgages for home purchases that were beyond their means and to people whose ability to repay and whose credit rating were less than prime</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> These lenders would sell these mortgages to Wall Street, and Wall Street would bundle these mortgages into stock offerings, and many funds invested in these offerings</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In 2007, this bubble burst as the real-estate market weakened and interest rates increased → many subprime borrowers found themselves underwater - the market value of their homes sank below the amount they owed on their mortgages</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Their only option was to walk away from their homes, leading to widespread foreclosures</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The automobile industry also went into financial crisis in 2008, partly as a result of reduced consumer spending and a result of rising fuel prices</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Bush agreed to lend $17.4 billion to GM and Chrysler to keep them afloat, and Obama continued to extend those loans</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This provided $800 billion to state and local governments to be used for infrastructure, projects, schools, and hospitals</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This reflected Keynes, who wrote The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, arguing that during times of recession, the government should increase spending</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Unemployment went down during Obama’s time in office, however, it is not clear how much of that was because of the stimulus package and how much of it was due to a generally improving economy</div>

The Economy in the Digital Age
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> The Digital Revolution</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Apple launched a PC in 1977 and IBM followed; in the early 1980s, Microsoft developed operating systems, and through the 1980s, PC became ubiquitous in workplaces</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Economic Productivity in the Digital Age</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Economists cite an increase in productivity growth as due to the widespread use of information technologies and the increase in the speed of communications across the globe</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> However, economists have noted that the increase in overall economic productivity has not led to the expected increases in standards of living</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Some cite the costs of replacing outdated equipment as a countervailing factor, while others cite the changing nature of work and the growing income gap as factors that prevent many ordinary Americans from enjoying the fruits of the digital revolution</div>

New Technologies, New Behaviors
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> The Development and Spread of the Internet</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The origins of the Internet date from the 1960s as the Department of Defense sought to create a computer system that would allow far-flung military installations to exchange computer information</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In the late 1980s, universities in the US created a computer network to facilitate the sharing of research while in Switzerland, engineers developed the World Wide Web</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Internet use grew rapidly in the 1990s and changed the way of life - email rendered letter writing obsolete, file sharing of music and video have forced the entertainment industry to rethink its business model, and traditional news outlets have been forced to compete with the instantaneous information available on the Internet</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> It allowed for virtual business meetings and allowed users to browse merchandise on their personal computers and purchase items without leaving their homes - making shopping easier but also driving many brick and mortar stores out of business</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Obama’s campaign demonstrated the power of the Internet to build a grassroots network of activists and contributors, and Twitter has served as a primary method for Trump to communicate with the public</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Critics note that smartphones tend to distract users from tasks such as driving and social interactions in front of them</div>

Economic Shifts: The Decline of Manufacturing and the Rise of the Service Sector
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> The Deindustrialization of America</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> From the 1960s onward, large numbers of factories have closed in cities such as NY, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Since the 1980s, there has been a rapid shift of the manufacturing sector out of the US and into less-developed parts of this world - a trend accelerated by free-trade agreements</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The rise of the private manufacturing sector in Communist China has also played a major role - because firms in China are able to produce goods at lower costs, American imports from China grew dramatically in the late 20th and early 21st century</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Decline of Union Membership</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In 1954, union membership in the US peaked at 35% while it is currently at 10%</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> A major turning point toward unionized workers came in 1981 under Reagan when he fired air traffic controllers who went on strike - this broke their union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers’ Organization, and was consistent with helping big business</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Every year, there were fewer strikes and lockouts</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> More recently, states passed right-to-work laws where workers can opt out of paying union dues, even while being represented by the union</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In addition, unions representing public workers have come under attack in several states, where legislation cut collective bargaining rights and benefits of public employees</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Median wages and benefits have fallen for teachers in states where this legislation has passed</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> The Growth of the Service Sector</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> It grew significantly from 1980 to present - the primary sector includes the extraction and production of raw materials and the secondary sector is considered manufacturing; the service sector is considered the tertiary sector which involves the production of services rather than end products</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The service sector includes shipping and trucking, banking services, IT, waste disposal, education, government, healthcare, legal services, and a whole host of retail and food-service operations</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Currently, 70% of jobs in the US are in the service sector, representing a shift in the economy from the production of things to the providing of services</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The growth of low wage jobs in the retail and fast-food fields has contributed to the stagnation of wages and to a growing income gap - and efforts to unionize workers in these fields have almost all failed due to anti-union activities by the corporations</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The goal of a $15 minimum wage has been a rallying cry of this movement</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> The Growth of the “Gig Economy”</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The growth of the Internet has contributed to the growth of the “Gig Economy”</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> TaskRabbit and Uber are prominent companies - 36% of American workers are involved in the gig economy</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> For some, gig work supplements their current income, others join the gig economy because they cannot find full-time employment</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Although this may provide flexibility, the gig economy does not provide employee benefits or worker protections, and often results in low pay</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Increasing Wealth Inequality
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> The Growth of the Income Gap</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The incomes for the top earning one percent of households increased by about 275% between 1979 and 2007, while the middle of 60% of wage-earners saw their income rise by just under 40%</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Many economists cite the disappearance of higher-paying manufacturing jobs and the growth of low-wage service-sector jobs and “gig” work</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Other factors include the decline of union movement and changes in the tax code, including massive tax cuts initiated by W Bush, and the Great Recession</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The growth of the gig economy has tended to depress income for workers, and calls for a fundamental restructuring of the economy in order to challenge economic inequality have formed the basis of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the campaigns of Sanders</div>
</li>

<ol>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Spanish, French, Dutch, and British colonizers had different economic and imperial goals involving land and labor that shaped the social and political development of their colonies as well as their relationships with native populations.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Spanish efforts to extract wealth from the land led them to develop institutions based on subjugating native populations, converting them to Christianity, and incorporating them, along with enslaved and free Africans, into the Spanish colonial society.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Christopher Columbus, Cortez, Pizarro, conquistadores, mission system, encomienda system, New Spain, establishment of Santa Fe (1610)</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> French and Dutch colonial efforts involved relatively few Europeans and relied on trade alliances and intermarriage with American Indians to build economic and diplomatic relationships and acquires furs and other products for export to Europe.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Samuel de Champlain, Coureurs de bois, New Netherland, Jesuit missionaries, French alliance with Huron Indians</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> English colonization efforts attracted a comparatively large number of male and female British migrants, as well as other European migrants, all of whom sought social mobility, economic prosperity, religious freedom, and improved living conditions. These colonists focused on agriculture and settled on land taken from Native Americans, from whom they lived separately.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Jamestown (1607), starving time, head-right system, John Rolfe, tobacco as cash crop</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> In the 17th century, early British colonies developed along the Atlantic coast, with regional differences that reflected various environmental, economic, cultural, and demographic factors.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> The Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies grew prosperous exporting tobacco — a labor-intensive product initially cultivated by white, mostly male indentured servants and later by enslaved Africans.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Middle Passage, indentured servants, Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), Chesapeake colonies, racial hierarchy</div>

<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Puritan work ethic, town meetings, expanded life expectancy in New England, social hierarchy, blue laws, subsistence farming, John Winthrop’s “city upon a hill”, Salem witch trials, trial of Anne Hutchinson, banishment of Roger Williams, establishment of Harvard College (1636)</div>

<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> The colonies of the southernmost Atlantic coast and the British West Indies used long growing seasons to develop plantation economies based on exporting staple crops. They depended on the labor of enslaved Africans, who often constituted the majority of the population in these areas and developed their own forms of cultural and religious autonomy.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. rice as cash crop in Georgia and the Carolinas, sugar as cash crop in Barbados, slave codes, Gullah, ring-shout, spirituals</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Distance and Britain’s initially lax attention led to the colonies creating self-governing institutions that were unusually democratic for the era. The New England colonies based power in participatory town meetings, which in turn elected members to their colonial legislatures; in the Southern colonies, elite planters exercised local authority and also dominated the elected assemblies.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Mayflower Compact (1620), Maryland Toleration Act (1649), House of Burgesses, Massachusetts General Court</div>

<ol>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> An Atlantic economy developed in which goods, as well as enslaved Africans and American Indians, were exchanged between Europe, Africa, and theAmericas through extensive trade networks. European colonial economies focused on acquiring, producing, and exporting commodities that were valued in Europe and gaining new sources of labor.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Triangular trade routes, direct trade routes, Middle Passage</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Continuing trade with Europeans increased the flow of goods in and out of American Indian communities, stimulating cultural and economic changes and spreading epidemic diseases that caused radical demographic shifts.</div>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Interactions between European rivals and American Indian populations fostered both accommodation and conflict. French, Dutch, British, and Spanish colonies allied with and armed American Indian groups, who frequently sought alliances with Europeans against other Indian groups.</div>

<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), revocation of Massachusetts’ charter, Navigation Acts/smuggling, protests against the Dominion of New England</div>
</li>

<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Anglo-Powhatan Wars (1610-1640s), Pequot War (1636-1637), King Philip’s War (1675-1676)</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> The British government increasingly attempted to incorporate its North American colonies into a coherent, hierarchical, and imperial structure in order to pursue mercantilist economic aims, but conflicts with colonists and American Indians led to erratic enforcement of imperial policies.</div>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Colonists’ resistance to imperial control drew on local experiences of self- government, evolving ideas of liberty, the political thought of the Enlightenment, greater religious independence and diversity, and an ideology critical of perceived corruption in the imperial system.</div>

<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Like other European empires in the Americas that participated in the Atlantic slave trade, the English colonies developed a system of slavery that reflected the specific economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics of those colonies.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> All the British colonies participated to varying degrees in the Atlantic slave trade due to the abundance of land and a growing European demand forcolonial goods, as well as a shortage of indentured servants. Small New England farms used relatively few enslaved laborers, all port cities held significant minorities of enslaved people, and the emerging plantation systems of the Chesapeake and the southernmost Atlantic coast had large numbers of enslaved workers, while the great majority of enslaved Africans were sent to the West Indies.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Triangular trade, Middle Passage, plantation agriculture</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> As chattel slavery became the dominant labor system in many southern colonies, new laws created a strict racial system that prohibited interracial relationships and defined the descendants of African American mothers as black and enslaved in perpetuity.</div>

<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Ideological and economic differences over slavery produced an array of diverging responses from Americans in the North and the South.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> The North’s expanding manufacturing economy relied on free labor in contrast to the Southern economy’s dependence on slave labor. Some Northerners did not object to slavery on principle but claimed that slavery would undermine the free labor market. As a result, a free-soil movement arose that portrayed the expansion of slavery as incompatible with free labor.</div>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Abraham Lincoln’s victory on the Republicans’ free-soil platform in the election of 1860 was accomplished without any Southern electoral votes.

<ol>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> The North’s greater manpower and industrial resources, the leadership of Abraham Lincoln and others, and the decision to emancipate slaves eventually led to the Union military victory over the Confederacy in the devastating Civil War.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Both the Union and the Confederacy mobilized their economies and societies to wage the war even while facing considerable home front opposition.</div>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Lincoln and most Union supporters began the Civil War to preserve the Union, but Lincoln’s decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation reframed the purpose of the war and helped prevent the Confederacy from gaining full diplomatic support from European powers. Many African Americans fled southern plantations and enlisted in the Union Army, helping to undermine the Confederacy.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Trent Affair (1861), Alabama commerce raider (1862), Emancipation Proclamation (1863), enlistment of African Americans, Massachusetts 54th Regiment (1863),</div>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Reconstruction and the Civil War ended slavery, altered relationships between the states and the federal government, and led to debates over new definitions of citizenship, particularly regarding the rights of African Americans, women, and other minorities.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> The 13th Amendment abolished slavery, while the 14th and15th Amendments granted African Americans citizenship, equal protection under the laws, and voting rights.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. 13th Amendment (1865), 14th Amendment (1868), 15th Amendment (1870)</div>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Efforts by radical and moderate Republicans to change the balance of power between Congress and the presidency and to reorder race relations in the defeated South yielded some short-term successes. Reconstruction opened up political opportunities and other leadership roles to former slaves, but it ultimately failed, due both to determined Southern resistance and the North’s waning resolve.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Black codes, Ku Klux Klan (1866), Presidential vs. Radical Reconstruction (1865-1867), Military Reconstruction (1867-1877), carpetbaggers, scalawags, Senator Hiram Revels, Senator Blache K Bruce, Representative Robert Smalls, Johnson’s veto of Freedmen&#039;s Bureau and Civil Rights Act of 1866, Tenure of Office Act (1867), impeachment of President Johnson (1868), Redeemer governments (Solid South), Enforcement Acts (1870-1871)</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Southern plantation owners continued to own the majority of the region’s land even after Reconstruction. Former slaves sought land ownership but generally fell short of self-sufficiency, as an exploitative and soil-intensive sharecropping system limited blacks’ and poor whites’ access to land in the South.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. black codes, sharecropping, tenant farming, crop-lien system, peonage system, Freedmen’s Bureau (1865)</div>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> The United States continued its transition from a rural, agricultural economy to an urban, industrial economy led by large companies.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> New technologies and manufacturing techniques helped focus the U.S. economy on the production of consumer goods, contributing to improved standards of living, greater personal mobility, and better communications systems.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> By 1920, a majority of the U.S. population lived in urban centers, which offered new economic opportunities for women, international migrants, and internal migrants.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Episodes of credit and market instability in the early 20th century, in particular the Great Depression, led to calls for a stronger financial regulatory system.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> In the Progressive Era of the early 20th century, Progressives responded to political corruption, economic instability, and social concerns by calling for greater government action and other political and social measures</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Some Progressive Era journalists attacked what they saw as political corruption, social injustice, and economic inequality, while reformers, often from the middle and upper classes and including many women, worked to effect social changes in cities and among immigrant populations.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> On the national level, Progressives sought federal legislation that they believed would effectively regulate the economy, expand democracy, and generate moral reform. Progressive amendments to the Constitution dealt with issues such as prohibition and woman suffrage.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Preservationists and conservationists both supported the establishment of national parks while advocating different government responses to the overuse of natural resources.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The Progressives were divided over many issues. Some Progressives supported Southern segregation, while others ignored its presence. Some Progressives advocated expanding popular participation in government, while others called for greater reliance on professional and technical experts to make government more efficient. Progressives also disagreed about immigration restriction.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> During the 1930s, policymakers responded to the mass unemployment and social upheavals of the Great Depression by transforming the U.S. into a limited welfare state, redefining the goals and ideas of modern American liberalism.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal attempted to end the Great Depression by using government power to provide relief to the poor, stimulate recovery, and reform the American economy.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Radical, union, and populist movements pushed Roosevelt toward more extensive efforts to change the American economic system, while conservatives in Congress and the Supreme Court sought to limit the New Deal’s scope.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Although the New Deal did not end the Depression, it left a legacy of reforms and regulatory agencies and fostered a long-term political realignment in which many ethnic groups, African Americans, and working- class communities identified with the Democratic Party</div>

<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> New forms of mass media, such as radio and cinema, contributed to the spread of national culture as well as greater awareness of regional cultures.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Migration gave rise to new forms of art and literature that expressed ethnic and regional identities, such the Harlem Renaissance movement.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Official restrictions on freedom of speech grew during World War I, as increased anxiety about radicalism led to a Red Scare and attacks on labor activism and immigrant culture.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> In the 1920s, cultural and political controversies emerged as Americans debated gender roles, modernism, science, religion, and issues related to race and immigration.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Economic pressures, global events, and political developments caused sharp variations in the numbers, sources, and experiences of both international and internal migrants.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Immigration from Europe reached its peak in the years before World War I. During and after World War I, nativist campaigns against some ethnic groups led to the passage of quotas that restricted immigration, particularly from southern and eastern Europe, and increased barriers to Asian immigration.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The increased demand for war production and labor during World War I and World War II and the economic difficulties of the 1930s led many Americans to migrate to urban centers in search of economic opportunities.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> In a Great Migration during and after World War I, African Americans escaping segregation, racial violence, and limited economic opportunity in the South moved to the North and West, where they found new opportunities but still encountered discrimination.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Migration to the United States from Mexico and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere increased, in spite of contradictory government policies toward Mexican immigration.</div>

<ol>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Participation in a series of global conflicts propelled the United States into a position of international power while renewing domestic debates over the nation’s proper role in the world</strong></div>
<ol>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> In the late 19th century and early 20th century, new U.S. territorial ambitions and acquisitions in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific accompanied heightened public debates over America’s role in the world.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Imperialists cited economic opportunities, racial theories, competition with European empires, and the perception in the 1890s that the Western frontier was “closed” to argue that Americans were destined to expand their culture and institutions to peoples around the globe.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Anti-imperialists cited principles of self-determination and invoked both racial theories and the U.S. foreign policy tradition of isolationism to argue that the U.S. should not extend its territory overseas.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The American victory in the Spanish–American War led to the U.S. acquisition of island territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific, an increase in involvement in Asia, and the suppression of a nationalist movement in the Philippines.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> World War I and its aftermath intensified ongoing debates about the nation’s role in the world and how best to achieve national security and pursue American interests.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> After initial neutrality in World War I, the nation entered the conflict, departing from the U.S. foreign policy tradition of noninvolvement in European affairs, in response to Woodrow Wilson’s call for the defense of humanitarian and democratic principles.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Although the American Expeditionary Forces played a relatively limited role in combat, the U.S.’s entry helped to tip the balance of the conflict in favor of the Allies.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Despite Wilson’s deep involvement in postwar negotiations, the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles or join the League of Nations.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> In the years following World War I, the United States pursued a unilateral foreign policy that used international investment, peace treaties, and select military intervention to promote a vision of international order, even while maintaining U.S. isolationism.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> In the 1930s, while many Americans were concerned about the rise of fascism and totalitarianism, most opposed taking military action against the aggression of Nazi Germany and Japan until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States into World War II.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> U.S. participation in World War II transformed American society, while the victory of the United States and its allies over the Axis powers vaulted the U.S. into a position of global, political, and military leadership.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Americans viewed the war as a fight for the survival of freedom and democracy against fascist and militarist ideologies. This perspective was later reinforced by revelations about Japanese wartime atrocities, Nazi concentration camps, and the Holocaust.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The mass mobilization of American society helped end the Great Depression, and the country’s strong industrial base played a pivotal role in winning the war by equipping and provisioning allies and millions of U.S. troops.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Mobilization and military service provided opportunities for women and minorities to improve their socioeconomic positions for the war’s duration, while also leading to debates over racial segregation. Wartime experiences also generated challenges to civil liberties, such as the internment of Japanese Americans.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The United States and its allies achieved military victory through Allied cooperation, technological and scientific advances, the contributions of servicemen and women, and campaigns such as Pacific “island-hopping” and the D-Day invasion. The use of atomic bombs hastened the end of the war and sparked debates about the morality of using atomic weapons.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> The war-ravaged condition of Asia and Europe, and the dominant U.S. role in the Allied victory and postwar peace settlements, allowed the United States to emerge from the war as the most powerful nation on earth.</div>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> As the United States focused on containing communism, it faced increasingly complex foreign policy issues, including decolonization, shifting international alignments and regional conflicts, and global economic and environmental changes.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Postwar decolonization and the emergence of powerful nationalist movements in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East led both sides in the Cold War to seek allies among new nations, many of which remained non aligned.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Cold War competition extended to Latin America, where the U.S. supported non-Communist regimes with varying levels of commitment to democracy.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Ideological, military, and economic concerns shaped U.S. involvement in the Middle East, with several oil crises in the region eventually sparking attempts at creating a national energy policy.</div>

<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Americans debated policies and methods designed to root out Communists within the United States even as both parties tended to support the broader Cold War strategy of containing communism.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Although the Korean conflict produced some minor domestic opposition, the Vietnam War saw the rise of sizable, passionate, and sometimes violent antiwar protests that became more numerous as the war escalated.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Americans debated the merits of a large nuclear arsenal, the “military-industrial complex,” and the appropriate power of the executive branch in conducting foreign and military policy.</div>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <strong>New movements for civil rights and liberal efforts to expand the role of government generated a range of political and cultural responses</strong></div>
<ol>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Seeking to fulfill Reconstruction-era promises, civil rights activists and political leaders achieved some legal and political successes in ending segregation, although progress toward equality was slow and halting.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Following World War II, civil rights activists utilized a variety of strategies — legal challenges, direct action, and nonviolent protest tactics — to combat racial discrimination.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Fannie Lou Hamer, John Lewis, Thurgood Marshall</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Decision-makers in each of the three branches of the federal government used measures including desegregation of the armed services, Brown v. Board of Education, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to promote greater racial justice.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Continuing white resistance slowed efforts at desegregation, sparking a series of social and political crises across the nation, while tensions among civil rights activists over tactical and philosophical issues increased after 1965.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Stirred by a growing awareness of inequalities in American society and by the African American civil rights movement, activists also addressed issues of identity and social justice, such as gender/sexuality and ethnicity</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Activists began to question society’s assumptions about gender and to call for social and economic equality for women and for gays and lesbians.</div>

<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Despite the perception of overall affluence in postwar America, advocates raised awareness of the prevalence and persistence of poverty as a national problem, sparking efforts to address this issue.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> As many liberal principles came to dominate postwar politics and court decisions, liberalism came under attack from the left as well as from resurgent conservative movements.</div>
<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Liberalismreached its zenith with Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society efforts to use federal power to end racial discrimination, eliminate poverty, and address other social issues while attacking communism abroad.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> Liberal ideals were realized in Supreme Court decisions that expanded democracy and individual freedoms, Great Society social programs and policies, and the power of the federal government, yet these unintentionally helped energize a new conservative movement that mobilized to defend traditional visions of morality and the proper role of state authority.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Griswold v. Connecticut, Miranda v. Arizona</div>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> A burgeoning private sector, continued federal spending, the baby boom, and technological developments helped spur economic growth, middle-class suburbanization, social mobility, a rapid expansion of higher education, and the rise of the “Sun Belt” as a political and economic force.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3 node"><div class="li"> These economic and social changes, in addition to the anxiety engendered by the Cold War, led to an increasingly homogeneous mass culture, as well as challenges to conformity by artists, intellectuals, and rebellious youth.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Ex. Beat Movement, The Affluent Society, rock and roll music</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Conservatives, fearing juvenile delinquency, urban unrest, and challenges to the traditional family, increasingly promoted their own values and ideology.</div>

<ol>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Internal migrants as well as migrants from around the world sought access to the economic boom and other benefits of the United States, especially after the passage of new immigration laws in 1965.</div>
