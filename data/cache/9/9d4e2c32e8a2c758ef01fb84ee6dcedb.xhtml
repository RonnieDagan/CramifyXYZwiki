<strong>Cell Type</strong> <strong>Prokaryote</strong> <strong>Eukaryotes</strong> <strong>Size</strong> Smaller Bigger <strong>Multi or Uni</strong> Uni Multi <strong>Organelles</strong> No (Nucleus) Yes (Nucleus) <strong>Cell Wall</strong> Yes Plants, Fungi, and some Protists <strong>Cytoplasm</strong> No cytoskeleton Cytoplasm streaming <strong>Ribosomes</strong> Yes: smaller, diff proteins Yes: bigger <strong>DNA</strong> Yes: singular, short, circular chromosome w/o histones  <br/>
Usually no introns<br/>
Less DNA that is in the nucleoid/cytoplasm<br/>
Some contain plasmids<br/>
Yes: multiple linear packaged with histone proteins &amp; capped w/ telomeres  <br/>
Usually has introns <br/>
Chromosome enclosed in  nucleus → large genome<br/>
<strong>Cell Division</strong> Binary Fission Meiosis or Mitosis <strong>Transfer of DNA</strong> Only fragments Thru meiosis <strong>Flagella and Cilia</strong> When present are made from globular protein flagellin &amp; not microtubules enclosed by plasma membrane When present are of protein tubulin “9 + 2” array <strong>Modes of Nutrition</strong> Autotrophs: make their own organic molecules <strong>Photoautotrophs</strong> Use light energy (as in photosynthesis) <strong>Chemoautotrophs</strong> Use energy obtained from inorganic substances (as in chemosynthesis) Heterotrophs: obtain carbon &amp; energy from other organisms <strong>Parasites</strong> Obtain energy from their hosts while living on or in their tissues <strong>Decomposers</strong> Obtain energy from dead, decaying matter <strong>Domain Bacteria</strong>
