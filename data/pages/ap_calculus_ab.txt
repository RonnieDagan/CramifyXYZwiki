====== Unit 1 – Limits and Continuity ======

What is a limit and how to find it:\\ \\ **Limit:** If f(x) **becomes close to a unique number L as x approaches c from either side,** then\\ the limit of f(x) as x approaches c is L.\\ \\ 

  * A limit refers to the y-value of a function

  * In the picture below, you can tell that the two limits don’t equal each other, thus theanswer to this limit is DNE.

  * If m=n, then the limit equals a_b

**Finding Vertical Asymptotes**\\ The only step you have to do is\\ **set the denominator equal to zero and solve.**

  * Example: [[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_8|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_8.png}}]] 
    * (x+2)(x-2) = 0 → x = 2, -2
      * 2 is a removable hole while -2 is the non-removable vertical asymptote.

Finding Horizontal Asymptotes\\ Use the\\ **two terms of the highest degree in the numerator and denominator**

  * Example [[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_9|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_9.png}}]] 
    * x and x2 are the two terms of the highest degree in the numerator and denominatorrespectively. After finding it, use the limits at infinity rule to determine the limit.

**Intermediate Value Theorem**\\ A continuous function on a\\ **closed interval cannot skip values.**\\ ● f(x) must be continuous on the given interval [a,b]\\ ● f(a) and f(b) cannot equal each other.\\ ● f(c) must be in between f(a) and f(b)\\ \\ Example #1: Apply the IVT, if possible on [0,5] so that f(c)=1 for the function

f(x)=x2+x+1

  - f(x) is continuous because it is a polynomial function.

  - f(a)=f(0)=1f(b)=f(5)=29

  - By the IVT, there exists a value c where f(c)=1 since 1 is between -1 and 29.Example #2:

Example #2:

  - f(a) = f(0) = -20f(b) = f(60) =10

  - By the IVT, there is a time t where v(t)=-5 on the interval [0,60] since -20 < -5 < 10

====== Unit 2 - Differentiation: Definition and Basic Derivative Rules ======

**What is a derivative?**

  * **Derivative**: The slope of the tangent line at a particular point; also known as the**instantaneous rate of change.**

  * The derivative of f(x) is denoted as f’(x) or

[[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_12|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_12.png}}]]
**Derivatives as Limits**

[[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_13|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_13.png}}]]
**Steps to find derivatives as limits:**

  - Identify the form of the derivative first (look at the image above)… is it form a? b? c?

  - Identify f(x)

  - Derive f(x) using the corresponding equations next to each form

  - Plug in the “c” value if applicable

**Rules of Differentiation**

[[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_17|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_17.png}}]]  
* HINT: If the original function starts with C, then the derivative is negative!
    * Example: cosx, cotx, & cscx

**Derivative Rule for LN**

[[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_18|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_18.png}}]]  
* HINT: [Derive over copy]
    * Example: h(x) = ln(2x^2 + 1)
      * First derive 2x^2 + 1. That would be 4x! And then put that over theoriginal function, which would be 2x^2 + 1.
      * Your answer would then be 4x%%_(%%2x^2 + 1)

**Deriving Exponential Functions**

[[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_19|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_19.png}}]]

**Continuity**

A function f is continuous at “c” if:

  * The value exists- The value of the function is defined at “c” and f(c) exists

  * The limit exists - The limit of the function must exist at “c”
    * The left and right limits must equal

  * Function=limit. The value of the function at “c” must equal the value of the limit at “c”

**Discontinuity**

  * **Removable** → discontinuity at “c” is called removable if the function can becontinuous by defining f(c)

  * **Non-removable** → discontinuity at “c” is called non-removable if the function cannotbe made continuous by redefining f(c)

**Differentiability**

**In order for a function to be differentiable at x = c:**

  * The function must be continuous at x = c

  * Its **left and right** derivative must equal each other at x = c

Example:

  * HINT: How I memorize antiderivatives by using derivatives of trigonometric functions
    * EX: d_dx sinx = cosx and for the antiderivative, you just switch the twotrigonometric functions and add +C since it’s an indefinite integration.
    * EX: d_dx cscx = -cscxcotx and for the antiderivative, just switch the twotrigonometric functions and add +c since it’s an indefinite integration. Also, if thederivative was negative, then the anti-derivative is also negative!
