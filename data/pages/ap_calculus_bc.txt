====== Unit 1 – Limits and Continuity ======

What is a limit and how to find it:\\ \\ **Limit:** If f(x) **becomes close to a unique number L as x approaches c from either side,** then\\ the limit of f(x) as x approaches c is L.\\ \\ 

  * A limit refers to the y-value of a function

**Finding Vertical Asymptotes**\\ The only step you have to do is\\ **set the denominator equal to zero and solve.**

  * Example: [[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_8|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_8.png}}]] 
    * (x+2)(x-2) = 0 → x = 2, -2
      * 2 is a removable hole while -2 is the non-removable vertical asymptote.

Finding Horizontal Asymptotes\\ Use the\\ **two terms of the highest degree in the numerator and denominator**

  * Example [[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_9|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_9.png}}]] 
    * x and x2 are the two terms of the highest degree in the numerator and denominatorrespectively. After finding it, use the limits at infinity rule to determine the limit.

**Intermediate Value Theorem**\\ A continuous function on a\\ **closed interval cannot skip values.**\\ ● f(x) must be continuous on the given interval [a,b]\\ ● f(a) and f(b) cannot equal each other.\\ ● f(c) must be in between f(a) and f(b)\\ \\ Example #1: Apply the IVT, if possible on [0,5] so that f(c)=1 for the function

f(x)=x2+x+1

  - f(x) is continuous because it is a polynomial function.

  - f(a)=f(0)=1f(b)=f(5)=29

  - By the IVT, there exists a value c where f(c)=1 since 1 is between -1 and 29.Example #2:

Example #2:

  - f(a) = f(0) = -20f(b) = f(60) =10

  - By the IVT, there is a time t where v(t)=-5 on the interval [0,60] since -20 < -5 < 10

**Steps to find derivatives as limits:**

  - Identify the form of the derivative first (look at the image above)… is it form a? b? c?

  - Identify f(x)

  - Derive f(x) using the corresponding equations next to each form

* HINT: If the original function starts with C, then the derivative is negative!
    * Example: cosx, cotx, & cscx

**Derivative Rule for LN**

[[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_18|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_18.png}}]]  
* HINT: [Derive over copy]
    * Example: h(x) = ln(2x^2 + 1)
      * First derive 2x^2 + 1. That would be 4x! And then put that over theoriginal function, which would be 2x^2 + 1.
      * Your answer would then be 4x%%_(%%2x^2 + 1)

**Deriving Exponential Functions**

[[AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_19|{{AP_Calc_AB_Study_Guide_f289051ba2044b4ab01d25945296aa61:Untitled_19.png}}]]

**Continuity**

A function f is continuous at “c” if:

  * The value exists- The value of the function is defined at “c” and f(c) exists

  * The limit exists - The limit of the function must exist at “c”
    * The left and right limits must equal

  * Function=limit. The value of the function at “c” must equal the value of the limit at “c”

**Discontinuity**

  * **Removable** → discontinuity at “c” is called removable if the function can becontinuous by defining f(c)

  * **Non-removable** → discontinuity at “c” is called non-removable if the function cannotbe made continuous by redefining f(c)

**Differentiability**

**In order for a function to be differentiable at x = c:**

  * The function must be continuous at x = c

  * Its **left and right** derivative must equal each other at x = c

Example:

  * HINT: How I memorize antiderivatives by using derivatives of trigonometric functions
    * EX: d_dx sinx = cosx and for the antiderivative, you just switch the twotrigonometric functions and add +C since it’s an indefinite integration.
    * EX: d_dx cscx = -cscxcotx and for the antiderivative, just switch the twotrigonometric functions and add +c since it’s an indefinite integration. Also, if thederivative was negative, then the anti-derivative is also negative!

======Unit 9:  Defining and Differentiating Parametric Equations======
  * **Parametric** functions: a pair of functions that allow you to find the coordinates of both x
and y, usually written in terms of ‘t’
    * Parametric equations are usually written in terms of ‘t’.
  * Calculating the derivative of parametric functions:

{{:pasted:20240410-222424.png}}
  * Calculating the second derivative of parametric equations:
{{:pasted:20240410-222441.png}}
    * Using the example from above, to find the second derivative of that parametric function, take the derivative of $\frac{dy}{dx} \rightarrow \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\frac{(3/2)}{2t}=\frac{3}{4t}$
  * Finding the arc length of parametric curves:
    * {{:pasted:20240410-222754.png}}
      * From t=𝛼 to t=𝛽
    * Ex. (from Princeton book): Find the length of the curve defined by x=sin(t) and
y=cos(t), from t=0 to t=$\pi$
      * 1) find (dx/dt) and (dy/dt) → $\frac{dx}{dt}=cos(t)$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}=-sin(t)$
      * 2) plug into the formula →
      * {{:pasted:20240410-222957.png}}
  * **Vectors**
    * Vectors are quantities that have both a magnitude and direction
    * Vector functions are similar to parametric functions because they describe the
motion of a particle on a plane
    * Vector functions have similar relationships between position, velocity, and
acceleration as we’ve seen earlier.
      * If a vector function P = position of a particle, then the derivative of P gives
you velocity, and the derivative of velocity gives you the particle’s
acceleration
        * Both x(t) and y(t) have to be differentiable for the vector function
to be differentiable as well
        * To find speed of a vector function, take the magnitude of the
velocity vector function
          * The magnitude of a vector function = $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$
    * Denotation of vectors:
    * {{:pasted:20240410-223144.png}}
      * ‘i’ and ‘j’ are the unit vectors in the x and y directions
      * x(t) and y(t) are real valued functions of the variable ‘t’
    * Ex. (from Saxon Calc BC book): 
    * {{:pasted:20240410-223210.png}}
    * Integrating vector valued functions:
      * Similar to how you take the derivative of vector valued functions by
differentiating x(t) and y(t), and leaving the ‘i’ and ‘j’, to find the integral of vector-valued functions, integrate the real-valued functions and leave
the ‘i’ and ‘j’
      * Integrating a velocity vector gives you the displacement of the particle
over the interval of time, and integrating a speed vector gives you the total
distance travelled by the particle in that interval.
      * Ex.:
      * {{:pasted:20240410-223246.png}}
  * **Polar curves:**
    * Polar coordinates: used to describe the location of points on a polar curve/graph
      * x = rcos𝜃and y = rsin𝜃
        * *x and y are defined parametrically, in terms of ‘𝜃′
      * Differentiating in polar form:
        * To find $\frac{dy}{dx}$, use the equation for finding the slope of a parametric equation → $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/d\theta}{dx/d\theta}$
        * {{:pasted:20240410-223450.png}}
     * **Finding the area of a single polar curve:**

         * *to find polar area, you will often need to know these trig
identities:
           * {{:pasted:20240410-223559.png}}
         * To find the limits of the integral, find the𝜃points where r consists of that region.
           * In this case, it takes from 0 to 2𝜋for “r” to be drawn completely, which is why those are the limits
     * Finding the area of a region bounded by 2 polar curves:
       * A = $\int_a^b \frac{1}{2}(r_2^2-r_1^2)d\theta$ with $r_2(\theta) > r_1(\theta)$ 
       * Ex. (from Princeton book): find the area inside the circle r = 4 and outside of the curve r = 4 - cos𝜃(the shaded region in the graph below)
       * {{:pasted:20240410-223811.png}}
       * 1) To find the limits of the integral, set the two equations equal to each other, and solve for 𝜃→ 4 = 4 - cos𝜃 = cos𝜃 = 0 at 𝜃= -𝜋/2 and 𝜋/2
       * 2) find which function is on the “outside”, and in this case, r = 4 is
         * {{:pasted:20240410-224911.png}}

======Unit 10: Infinite Sequences and Series======

  * Difference between sequences and series:
    * $a_n$ = sequence
    * S = $\Sigma_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ = series
    * Sequences are lists of the terms, whereas series are lists of the addends of the series. 
      * Series: to find the second term of the series, you ADD $𝑎_1$ and $𝑎_2$ together
        * This is known as partial sums → 2nd partial sum = $S_2 = a_1 + a_2$
          * nth partial sum = the sum of the first n terms of the series
      *** Convergence/Divergence:**
        * A series converges only if the SEQUENCE OF PARTIAL SUMS (𝑆𝑛) converges to a finite number. If it doesn’t converge, then it diverges. 
          * {{:pasted:20240410-225330.png}}
  * **Geometric series:**
    * Defined as a series with a constant ratio between each term
    * {{:pasted:20240410-225416.png}}
    * If |r| < 1, then the geometric series converges to $|frac{a}{1-4}$
      * {{:pasted:20240410-225457.png}}
    * If |𝑟| > 1, 𝑜𝑟 = 1,then the series diverges

      * {{:pasted:20240410-230528.png}}
      * Absolute convergence:
        * If an alternating series converges after taking the absolute value of the series function, then that series is said to converge absolutely 
          * {{:pasted:20240410-230626.png}}
        * {{:pasted:20240410-230632.png}}
      * **Conditional convergence:**
        * If an alternating series converges, and does NOT converge absolutely, then it’s said to converge conditionally
        * An alternating series that conditionally converges must follow these conditions:

    * **Radius and interval of convergence of power series:**
    * {{:pasted:20240410-230929.png}}
            * You have to check the endpoints of the interval to see if the function converges at the endpoints! If it does converge at an endpoint, place the interval in brackets, and if not, place the interval in parentheses.
              * If it converges at 1 endpoint and not the other, denote it like this: [a,b) or (a,b], with the bracket indicating convergence at that endpoint
          * **Radius of convergence: **
            * Similar to how the radius of a circle describes the length from the outer edge of the circle to the centerpoint, the radius of convergence describes the distance between the midpoint and the endpoint of the interval of convergence.
            * In the example above, the interval of convergence was [-1,1]. Thus, the radius of convergence is 1, since the midpoint of that interval is 0, and the distance between 0 (the midpoint) and 1 (the endpoint) is 1.
