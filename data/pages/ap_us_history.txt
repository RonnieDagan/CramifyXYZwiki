    * Competing theories on republicanism emerged - the idea that citizens led simple lives and were virtuous, or Adam Smith’s view that rational self-interest and competition can lead to greater prosperity for all

===== The American Revolution =====

The War for Independence - Factors in the Victory of the Patriot CAuse

  * Lexington and Concord
    * First battle of the war in April 1775

  * Factors in the Outcome of the War
    * The British had a highly trained, professional army, the strongest navy, and substantial financial resources, and also had the support of the Loyalists in the colonies
    * They offered freedom to slaves who joined Britain, and could count on many Indian tribes for support
    * However, they had the French as enemies, and were fighting far away from home
    * Many Patriot soldiers believed firmly in their cause, and they had the leadership of George Washington, Nathanael Green, and Henry Knox

  * The Three Phases of the American Revolution
    * At first, the British thought that the revolution was started by a minority, and suffered heavy losses (although they won) in the Battle of Bunker Hill, and retreated from New England
    * Second, the British tried to gain control of New York to isolate New England and drove Washington and his troops out of New York in 1776
      * However, they were defeated at the Battle of Saratoga, which showed France that the colonists could mount formidable forces for battle
      * France agreed to supply military assistance in 1778 due to its animosity towards Britain
    * The third phase was in the South, where Britain hoped to rally Loyalist sentiments and tap into the resentment of the slaves, but the aid of the French led Cornwallis to surrender at the Battle of Yorktown
      * In the North, fighting had reached a stalemate

Funding the War Effort

  * Currency, Inflation, and Financial Difficulties
    * The Continental Army was constantly underfunded and short of basic supplies because Congress did not have the ability to levy taxes and had to ask states for funds
    * They attempted to solve this by printing money which only led to inflation, and instead turned to printing certificates for frontier land

    * Vermont and Pennsylvania both outlawed slavery as well

Evolving Ideas on Gender

  * The importance of women during the Revolution set the stage for the evolution of ideas around gender

  * The idea of “republican motherhood” emerged in the decades after the American Revolution

  * Remember the Ladies
    * This phrase was sent by Abigail Adams to her husband John Adams in hopes that issues in gender inequality might be resolved - many women found analogies in tyranny of a king to tyranny of a husband over his wife

  * Republican Motherhood
    * It was the concept that women had civic responsibilities in the evolving culture of the new nation - John Locke asserted that marriage should involve a greater degree of consent
    * The experience that many women gained from participating in the struggle for independence empowered them
    * Republican motherhood did not mean political equality between men and women, but simply asserted that women had a role to play in civic life - that women were active agents in maintaining public virtue
    * These ideas expanded the possibilities for women to gain an education, to teach their children and raise the next generation of republican leaders

The Impact of the American Revolution Abroad

  * Revolution in France
    * Six years after the American Revolution ended, the French Revolution began - where the overthrowing of the king was supported by a majority of the American citizens, but abandoned when Robespierre began the reign of terror

  * Rebellion in Haiti
    * The white colonists resisted French rule because of the American and French Revolutions
    * Then the mixed-race planters rebelled, challenging their second-class status
    * Finally, the slaves rebelled, led by Toussaint L'Ouverture and aided by Spanish troops - which led many in the US to fear a slave rebellion of their own

    * There was the problem of inflation due to printing money, and the remaining war debt the government struggled to pay off
    * Morris proposed a 5% import tax to raise revenues, but RI and NY both rejected the necessary unanimous because of their thriving harbors

  * Shays’s Rebellion
    * Many farmers were unable to pay taxes in Massachusetts and were losing their farms to banks

    * After US independence, there was a debate about the land between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River
    * In the end, states gave up individual claims to the land and it became national land

  * Land Ordinances and the Northwest Ordinance
    * The Land Ordinance of 1784 divided the Northwest Territory into 10 potential new states, and the Land Ordinance of 1785 reduced the states to 5
    * In 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, setting up a process by which areas could become territories, and then states
    * Once the population of a territory reached 60,000, it could write a constitution and apply for statehood
    * It also banned slavery north of the Ohio River

  * Moving into the Northwest Territory

  * Conflicts with Great Britain and Jay’s Treaty
    * Britain was not pleased with US trade with France when Britain was in a war against France so they began intercepting ships, southern planters wanted reimbursement from the british for slaves that had fled because of British promises, and settlers were angry because of the British forces in forts in the Northwest, and Americans accused the British of aiding the Indians in US-Indian skirmishes
    * John Jay was sent to Britain and came back with a treaty where Britain agreed to withdraw from the West after 18 months without any compensation to shippers or planters for lost slaves
      * American planters would also be forced to repay debts to the British that dated from the colonial era, but the British allowed the US to trade in the West Indies
    * Hamilton saw the treaty as the best they could do, but Jefferson saw this as pro-British sympathy

Role of the United States in the Aftermath of the French Revolution

  * The Question of Alliances
    * When France went to war with Britain in 1793, many American felt the US had an obligation to help France and because of a treaty they had signed with France
    * However, others felt that the treaty was null because it was signed with the previous government, and they harbored warm feelings for the British system

  * Conflict with France and the XYZ Affair
    * In 1797, France began to seize American ships, to which Adams sent negotiators to Paris to attempt a peaceful settlement
    * They were not allowed to meet with the foreign affairs minister, and were approached by agents who asked for money in order to meet with Talleyrand
    * Congress allocated money and allowed ships to fight French ships in the Carribean, leading to America’s first undeclared war, the Quasi War
    * This helped instill respect for America’s navy, which had just been formed

Spanish missions in California

      * He thought it was important to have wealthy investors financial invested in the new government
    * Jefferson argued that this was against the Constitution, but Hamilton used the **elastic clause** to deem it was necessary and proper, and was signed into law in 1791

  * Dealing with Debt
    * He insisted that national war debt be paid back in full to enhance the bank’s legitimacy, and that state debts be assumed by the government and paid back
    * This was met with opposition by states that did not have a large debt or had already paid back their debts

  * Encouragement to Manufacturing

===== Movement in the Early Republic =====

Migrations, American Indians, and Shifting Alliances

  * The Status of American Indian Lands after the American Revolution
    * The land between the Appalachians and the Mississippi had been set aside as an Indian Reserve by the British, but the Treaty of Paris failed to address Indians’ status
    * As more Americans moved to the area, the status of Indians became more precarious

  * Treaty of Fort Stanwix
    * The government negotiated with the Iroquois Confederacy in 1784 and they agreed to cede the land north of the Ohio River, however, they did not own the land and the Shawnee, Delaware, and Miami who the land belonged to protested

  * American Defeat at the Wabash River
    * 600 American troops were killed by forces led by Miami warrior Little Turtle in present-day Ohio

  * The Battle of Fallen Timbers and the Treaty Greenville

Internal Migrations, Frontier Cultures, and Tensions in the Backcountry

  * The Dynamics of Backcountry Settlements
    * Tensions have existed since the 1600s between backcountry settlers and elite policymakers, ex. Bacon’s Rebellion (1676)
      * Backcountry Virginians were resentful of Governor William Berkeley and the House of Burgesses, arguing that they paid a disproportionate amount of taxes and were not represented in the House, and that government was not taking sufficient action against natives
    * Similarly, in the second half of the 1700s, the Carolina Regulators movement, made up of backcountry farmers in North and South Carolina, challenged the policies and practices of merchants, bankers, officials, and the colonial government
    * War of the Regulation - a catalyst for which was the collection of debts and the reliance of many farmers on bankers’ credit and loans which was full of corruption - was an uprising in an attempt to challenge the system of officials and sheriffs and the political infrastructure surrounding it

The Expansion of Slavery and Divergent Regional Attitudes Towards Slavery

  * The North Moves Toward a Free-Labor System
    * Many northerners saw unfree labor as inconsistent with the republican ideas of the American Revolution, and even indentured servitude would disappear by 1800
    * Northern states passed gradual emancipation laws which did not free existing slaves but provided the freedom of future children of slave women
    * Free-black communities developed in many northern states

  * The Growth of Slavery in the South
    * Slavery became increasingly important in the South due to Eli Whitney’s cotton gin
    * The number of slaves in the United States grew despite emancipation laws

===== Subject to Debate =====

  * Debating the Causes and Nature of the American Revolution
    * No taxation without representation is only one of the issues that led to the Revolution
    * Perhaps it was a new set of ideas about politics and democracy
    * Or maybe it was a class conflict in colonial America, between the colonial elites who wanted to maintain the colonial social structure, but without the British overlords, and the common people who wanted a real break with the hierarchies of the past

  * The Effectiveness of the Articles of Confederation
    * The Articles are not necessarily bad - the colonies won the American Revolution with the Articles and they did an excellent job in dealing with new western lands
    * Although the national government was weak, this can be seen as a positive as the Articles effectively protected the traditional rights of the states

  * The Nature of the Constitution
    * Is the Constitution simply a way for the men who wrote it to protect their economic interests?

    * Democratic-Republicans, following Jefferson, sought to limit the power of the national government and reserve greater authority at the state level
    * Election of 1800 - Adams (Federalist) vs. Jefferson (Democratic-Republican)
    * The votes ended up being tied between Burr and Jefferson, Hamilton advocated for Jefferson and he ended up winning the election
    * Jefferson labeled this transfer of power from the Federalists to the Democratic-Republicans the “revolution of 1800” because he believed he would return the US to its founding principles

  * Decline of the Federalist Party and the “Era of Good Feelings”
    * Despite fears of turmoil, power peacefully changed hands in 1800
    * The Federalists lost support because the Republican agricultural areas grew more rapidly than commercial centers of the north, and because of their opposition to the War of 1812
    * The “Era of Good Feelings” marked a time in the 1810s and 20s where only the Democratic-Republicans competed for votes, making it so that Monroe easily won the election of 1816
    * However, the Supreme Court kept alive alive many elements of the Federalist agenda

The Supreme Court Asserts Federal Power and the Power of the Judiciary

  * Chief Justice John Marshall issued a series of decisions that extended the power of the federal government over state laws, as well as establishing that the Supreme Court was the final say in interpreting the Constitution

  * Marbury v. Madison (1803) and the Principle of Judicial Review
    * Judicial Review - review of the constitutionality of an act or law
    * Adams tried to fill seats of judges during the last days of his presidency, but some were blocked by Jefferson
    * Marbury, a potential judge, sued to have his commission, but SCOTUS ruled that Marbury was not entitled to his seat because the Adams’s law was unconstitutional
    * This established SCOTUS’s power to review laws and determine whether they are consistent with the Constitution

  * The Marshall Court and Federal Power
    * McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) prohibited Maryland from taxing the Second Bank of the United States
    * Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) invalidated a monopoly on ferry transportation between NY and NJ, asserting that only the USFG could regulate interstate trade
    * Cohens v. Virginia (1821) affirmed the right of SCOTUS to receive appeals from state courts
    * Worcester v. Georgia (1832) held that any dealings with American Indians be carried out by the USFG, upholding the autonomy of American Indian communities

The Louisiana Purchase and Territorial Expansion

  * The Louisiana Purchase
    * France, under Napoleon, sold the Louisiana Territory (land beyond the Mississippi) to the United States for $15 million
    * Although it was unconstitutional to acquire new lands, Jefferson went against his strict constructionist view of the Constitution and made the purchase
    * It doubled the territory of the United States, and the US gained full control of the port of New Orleans at the Mississippi River, skyrocketing US economic growth

  * The Lewis and Clark Expedition
    * Meriwether Lewis and William Clark explored and mapped the Louisiana territory, seeking practical routes, and established the presence of the US in the West

===== Politics and Regional Interests =====

The Persistence of Regional Priorities

  * Regional economic interests often trumped national interest

  * The Market Economy and Regional Loyalties
    * Industry in the northern states and slavery in the south, although some regions became more interlinked as local economies were transformed into national markets, the issue of free vs. slavery divided the country

The American System and Sectionalism

  * Henry Clay’s “American System”
    * In the nationalist mood that followed the War of 1812, Clay put forth a series of economic proposals
      * Internal improvements - better transportation and infrastructure
      * High tariffs on imported goods to promote American Manufacturing
      * Chartering the Second Bank of the United States in order to stabilize the economy and make credit more readily available

  * The Growing Isolation of the South
    * Roads and railroads tended to connect the North and ignore the South, and settlers tended to move westward instead of South, eventually isolating the South politically

A Temporary Truce on the Slavery Question in the Pre-Civil War Period

  * Missouri Compromise
    * If Missouri was admitted into the US, it would have upset the balance of 11 free and 11 slave states, and so Missouri was admitted as a slave state and Maine as a free state
    * It also divided the remaining area of the Louisiana Territory at the 36*30’ north latitude, where above that line slavery was not permitted

  * The “Gag Rule” in the House of Representatives
    * Abolitionists pressed congressmen to introduce and debate antislavery laws, and in response, southern politicians successfully pushed for resolutions that would table antislavery propositions, preventing them from being debated, “gagging” them

===== America on the World Stage =====

Trade, Diplomacy, and the Expansion of American Influence

  * The Barbary Wars (1801-1805, 1815)
    * Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, collectively known as the Barbary Coast, controlled trade in the Mediterranean, and demanded large payments from trading nations as tribute, otherwise they were subject to plundering by pirates
    * In 1801, Tripoli demanded a steep increase in payment and Jefferson refused, leading to the First Barbary War - where in the end, Tripoli agreed to release hostages and stop raiding American ships for $60,000
    * However, raiding did not stop, leading to the Second Barbary War, bringing an end to the American practice of paying tribute

  * Ongoing Troubles with European Nations
    * Although the US attempted to remain neutral and trade with both France and Britain while they were at war, Britain impressed American sailors
    * In 1807, British warship Leopard fired on the USS Chesapeake, where 4 Americans were abducted and 3 were killed

  * “Peaceful Coercion” and Free Trade
    * As Britain continued to interfere with American shipping, Jefferson passed the Embargo Act (1807), which cut off US trade to all foregin ports in hopes that this would persuade other nations to leave US ships alone
    * However, all this did was cripple America’s mercantile sector, and it was replaced by the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 which only prohibited trade with France and Britain - which was just as unpopular because they were the US’s 2 biggest trading partners

  * Macon’s Bill No. 2 (1810)
    * In an attempt to revive trade, this bill was passed that said the US would prohibit trade with the enemy of the nation that agreed to respect America’s rights as a neutral nation at sea - Napoleon agreed and the US cut trade to Britain in 1811
    * However, France continued to seize American ships and the cutting of trade with Britain worsened relations and pushed the two nations to war

  * The War of 1812
    * Trade conflicts and pressure from the War Hawks pushed President Madison to declare war against Britain in 1812
    * The war lasted 2 ½ years - Britain won early battles at Fort Dearborn and Fort Detroit, but in 1813, the US burned the city of York, won the Battle of the Thames in Canada where they defeated British and Indian forces and killed the Indian leader Tecumseh
    * The British burned down the White House and the Capitol in one incident
    * A peace treaty was signed in 1814, but without realizing it, Andrew Jackson achieved a major victory at New Orleans in 1815

  * The Hartford Convention and Opposition to the War of 1812
    * The War of 1812 was unpopular with New England merchants who saw their trade with Britain disappear, and Federalists met in Hartford to express their displeasure, and ended in a resolution calling for a ⅔ Congress majority for declarations of war

  * The Treaty of Ghent (1814)
    * Ended the war of 1812, the two sides agreed to stop fighting, give back territory seized in the war, and recognize the boundary between US and Canada
    * It did not mention Britain arming American Indians, interference with American shipping, or impressment of American seamen

  * “Old China Trade”
    * US merchants opened lucrative trade with China, not officially sanctioned by the USFG, known as “Old China Trade”
    * Driven by American demand for Chinese products, opened new markets to the US
    * Recognizing the growing power of Britain in China, the US signed the Treaty of Wanghia in 1844 in which China extended to the US the same trading privileges as Britain

  * Nationalist Sentiment and the Monroe Doctrine (1823)
    * President Monroe was alarmed at threats by the Holy Alliance of Russia, Prussia, and Austria to restore Spain’s lost American colonies
    * He issued the Monroe Doctrine as a statement warning European nations to keep their hands off the Americas, an important statement of intent, rather than actual ability to enforce this

  * The Adams-Onis Treaty (1819)
    * The US gained control over Florida with the Adams-Onis Treaty, it transferred control of Florida, accepted Spain’s claims to Texas, and settled the boundary between Louisiana and Spanish territory
    * The US wanted to gain control of Florida because it was a destination for escaped slaves

  * The Caroline Incident, the “Aroostook War”, and the Webster-Ashburton Treaty
    * The Webster-Ashburton Treaty split the disputed territory between Maine and British Canada, and settled a disagreement over the border between Minnesota and Canada
    * This border, although roughly drawn by the Treaty Paris, led to conflicts as more Canadians and Americans moved in to the area around Maine, and the brawling between the two groups was coined the “Aroostook War”
    * The Caroline incident was where British authorities burned an American vessel on the border of Minnesota and Canada which was being used by anti-British Canadian rebels to transport supplies. In response, New York officials had arrested a Canadian sheriff and threatened to execute him for participating in the murder of an American crew member

  * “Fifty-four Forty or Fight”: Negotiating the Oregon Border
    * Both Britain and the US laid claim to the Pacific Northwest, and in 1818, the two nations agreed on a “joint occupation” of the Oregon Country
    * Fifty-four Forty or Fight was the cry of Americans who wanted to own all the territory, and instead, a line was drawn at the 49th parallel - the current border between US and Canada

===== Market Revolution: Economic Transformations =====

The Market Revolution

  * The Expansion of Banking
    * Banking and credit were increasingly important, especially after the Panic of 1819 which demonstrated the volatility of the new market economy
    * The Second Bank of the US and newly chartered state banks extended credit, issuing bank notes, but valuations of currency were different in each states - but the ability of banks to put currency into the economy fueled economic growth

  * The Incorporation of America
    * States started writing incorporation laws allowing for the chartering of businesses, which provided investors with limited liability - investors could only lose the amount they invested and could not be held liable in civil suits

  * SCOTUS and the Market Economy
    * Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819) - SCOTUS ruled that Dartmouth’s colonial charter was still valid and could not be made a state college
    * Fletcher v. Peck (1810) - SCOTUS upheld a corrupt land deal between Georgia and individuals - they maintained that a contract should be upheld, although it might not have been in the public interest

Advances in Technology

  * Agricultural Efficiency
    * The steel plow, invented in 1847, was more durable and efficient than the cast-iron plow
    * The automatic reaper in 1831 cut and stacked wheat and other grains
    * The thresher loosened the grain kernels from the inedible husk

  * Eli Whiteney and Interchangeable Parts
    * Many industrial processes came to rely on interchangeable parts - parts of a specific item were made and could be rapidly assembled into finished products - an idea promoted by Eli Whitney

  * The Development of Steam Power
    * As steam power was developed in Britain, Fulton in the US developed a functioning steamboat, and steamboats dominated commercial shipping in the 20 years after 1807
    * Steam power also replaced water wheels at factories

  * Advances in Communication
    * Morse invented the first telegraph in 1844, and in 1850, telegraph lines were built around the country

Improvements in Transportation and Regional Interdependence

  * Canals and Roads
    * The construction of canals and roads, called internal improvements, expanded trade, and were usually built by private entities with subsidies from the government
    * The Erie Canal connected the hudson to the Great Lakes, New York to the interior of the country, dropping shipping costs by 90%
    * The National Road (Cumberland Road) stretched from Maryland to the Ohio River Valley

  * Railroads
    * The first tracks were laid in 1829 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and by 1860, they connected the country
    * It dropped costs of transportation significantly

Regional Specialization

  * Commerce, Trade, and Manufacturing in the North
    * The Waltham-Lowell system brought all stages of textile production under one roof by having employees live in company housing, and this system spread rapidly
    * The use of interchangeable parts was widespread to manufacturers of agricultural implements, tools, clocks, and ironware

  * The Growth of Cotton Production in the South
    * In the first half of the 1800s, cotton replaced other crops as the most profitable crop in the South as the North needed it for textile production
    * The cotton gin combined with the insatiable demand in the North and Britain for cotton led to 58% of American exports being cotton by 1860, and thereby the number of slaves as well

===== Market Revolution: Society and Culture =====

Migrations and New Communities in the Age of the Market Revolution

  * Irish Immigration
    * The potato famine led to many Irish immigrants to the US

  * German Immigration
    * Many German immigrants were skilled craftsmen and entrepreneurs who immigrated to the US to escape political repression following the failed revolution of 1848 in the German states

  * The Movement to the West
    * The West grew rapidly after the War of 1812 with expansion in roads, canals, and railroads
    * More than 4 million Americans settled in the west from 1800-1840
    * Many southern planters hoped to recreate the Cotton Kingdom in the less expensive lands of the west
    * Some migrants “squatted” on their new land, lacking legal title or deed
    * The towns of the Old Northwest resembled New England while the plantations and the slave labor system of the new lower South resembled the Old South

The Market Revolution’s Impact on Economic Class

  * Social Mobility, Class, and the “Free Labor” Ideology
    * The material wealth of the US grew dramatically in the market revolution; the average income and standard of living increased
    * It provided hope of social mobility - ability to move up the social ladder
    * It bolstered the “free labor” ideology, that it was possible for wage earners to actually own land and become independent of others - led Northerners to see their society as superior to that of the South
    * However, many workers were stuck in low-wage factory work, and there was wealth inequality with entrepreneurs and aristocrats holding the majority of the benefits and fortune
    * There was a growth of a middle class as well, and a growth of occupations such as lawyers, clerks, bank workers, etc.

  * The Development of Unions
    * A labor union allowed workers in a firm to bargain “collectively” with their employer
    * Mill workers in Lowell, MA organized as the Factory Girls Association staged two strikes, but had limited success by the Panic of 1837 and large scale Irish immigration
    * In Commonwealth v. Hunt, SCOTUS ruled that unions were legal, and several organizations such as the National Typographical Union and the Stone Cutters achieved success

Workers and New Methods of Production

  * The Putting Out System
    * Men and women performed a task arranged by an agent at home, which was usually part of a larger operation such as cutting leather which would later be turned into shoes
    * This provided jobs for people at various times of the year

  * Slater Mill and the Development of the Factory System
    * The first to industrialize was the textile industry
    * As early as the 1790s, Slater built the first factory in the US that spun cotton into yarn or thread, powered by the Blackstone River
    * Water, human, and animal power characterized industry in the pre-Civil War era

  * The Lowell System
    * Textile factories in Lowell Massachusetts drew in young women because they thought they could pay them less and that they would only be temporary because they would eventually get married
    * Many of these women experienced freedom and autonomy unheard of for young women at the time, and demonstrated this by going on strike following wage cuts, but were eventually replaced by Irish immigrants

Gender and Family Roles in the Age of the Market Revolution

  * Gentility, Domesticity, and the Middle-class Ideal
    * A new culture surrounded the middle class - one where women were seen as the weaker sex, in a world outside the world of money and politics

  * The “Cult of Domesticity” and the “Proper” Role for Women

  * The ideas of republican motherhood gave way to the conception of a middle-class woman’s place, seen as intellectually inferior and whose role was to maintain the house and care for children

  * The cult of domesticity insisted that women keep a proper Christian home in a separate sphere from men

  * The legal structure of the US already considered women second-class, they could not vote or sit on juries or were not entitled to protection against physical abuse by their husbands, and property they owned would become their husband’s if they married

  * This was under the legal doctrine of feme covert, where wives had no independent legal or political standing

===== Expanding Democracy =====

Participatory Democracy and an Expanding Electorate

  * The Growth of Popular Politics and the Elimination of Property Qualifications
    * Following the Era of Good Feelings, most states removed property qualifications for voting so that most free white males had the right to vote
    * This impulse to expand democratic participation was strongest in the new western states, and the old eastern states followed suit

  * The Dorr Rebellion and Resistance to the Expansion of Democracy
    * Webster led conservative opposition to democratic reform in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1820-21 arguing that power naturally and necessarily follows property
    * Federalist political leaders in MA were able to block several of the more egalitarian proposals of the convention
    * In RI, democratic reformers organized a People’s Convention in 1841 which wrote a new, more democratic, state constitution which most people agreed with
    * They tried to inaugurate a new governor, Thomas Dorr, but President Tyler put the Dorr Rebellion down with federal troops, but this reflected a popular desire for a more democratic governing structure

  * Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville
    * French writer Tocqueville, upon visiting the US, wrote Democracy in America describing how democracy in the US meant more than voting, that there was a belief in equality, active participation in voluntary civic organization, and the belief that individual initiative and note birth determined one’s success

===== Jackson and Federal Power =====

The Second Two-Party System: The Democrats and the Whigs

  * The Era of Good Feelings broke apart as the Jacksonian branch of the Democratic-Republicans became known as the Democratic Party, while their opponents were the Whigs, organized by Clay

  * Jacksonian Democracy
    * Jackson and his supporters were bitter because of the election of 1824 as although he had the largest number of electoral votes (no candidate reached the required number of electoral votes to be declared president), the House elected John Quincy Adams to become president
    * It was believed that Clay as the Speaker of the House convinced representatives to tilt the election towards Adams, and Adams named Clay his secretary of state, causing Jackson’s supporters to label it as a corrupt bargain
    * In the election of 1828, Jackson’s supporters painted Adams as elist, and his populist appeal helped him
    * This election was considered the first modern election, in the sense that because of the elimination of property qualifications for voting

  * The “Tariff of Abominations”
    * The Tariff Act of 1828, known as the Tariff of Abominations, dramatically raised tariff rates on many items and led to a reduction in trade between the US and Europe
    * This hit SC, which depended on cotton exports, especially hard

  * John C. Calhoun and the Nullification Crisis
    * The Tariff Act of 1828 especially angered southern politicians in SC - led by Calhoun, and although Jackson signed a new act to lower tariffs, they were not satisfied
    * These politicians upheld the theory that states had the right to nullify federal legislation, but SCOTUS ruled this invalid
    * Jackson was alarmed at the flouting of federal authority and passed the Force Bill in 1833 which authorized military force against SC, and Congress revised tariff rates again, providing relief for SC - both helped alleviate the crisis

  * Destruction of the Second Bank of the United States
    * Jackson argued that the bank put too much power into the hands of a small elite
    * He vetoed the rechartering of the bank and killed it - a move that played well with his voters and he won reelection
    * The federal deposits from the national bank to state banks

  * The Specie Circular and the Panic of 1837
    * Jackson’s suspicion of bankers and credit led him to issue the Specie Circular mandating that government land be sold only for hard currency (gold/silver)
    * This led to falling land prices and a shortage of government funds
    * Both the destruction of the national bank and the Specie Circular led to the Panic of 1837
    * Worst economic crisis that brought many canal and railroad projects to a halt, led to the collapse of banks and businesses, and led to high unemployment
    * The Panic also damaged the political fortunes of the Democrats, Van Buren did not address the economic crisis and so he lost to the Whig Party in the election of 1840 to Harrison

  * Whigs and Democrats
    * The Whigs were formed in 1833, and many supported government programs aimed at economic modernization, such as Clay’s American system
    * Issues tended to be less important/pressing in this period of American history, and both parties focused intently on winning elections and holding on to power

Contention Between Whites and American Indians Over Western Lands

  * American Indians and the West
    * In the early 1800s, white settlers were pouring into the Ohio River and it was never clear if the Indians who made agreements with whites did so with the authority of their people
    * Harrison, governor of Indiana at the time, negotiated the Treaty of Fort Wayne where Indians agreed to cede 3 million acres for a fee
    * However, the most important leader at the time, Tecumseh, was not present for this
    * He and his brother Tenskwatawa, “the Prophet”, were trying to unite all Indian nations east of the Mississippi River

  * Battle of Tippecanoe and the War Hawks
    * Settlers persuaded Harrison to wage war against Temcumseh’s confederation
    * The Battle of Tippecanoe ousted members of the confederacy and was an American victory
    * The War Hawks, led by Clay and Calhoun, accused Britain of encouraging and funding Temcumseh’s confederation, and pushed for military action against the British
    * This would allow the US to eliminate the Indian threat and perhaps invade Canada

  * Indian Removal Act (1830)
    * Many whites wanted to push into the interior of the South, which were the traditional lands of the “Five Civilized Tribes” - Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee-Creek, and Seminole
    * Federal policy had been to respect the rights of Indians to inhabit the land, however, Jackson adopted a policy of Indian removal
    * He pushed for the Removal Act of 1830

  * The “Trail of Tears”
    * Jackson and Buren pushed for Georgia to move Indians to the West despite Worcester v. Georgia, which declared that Indian tribes were subject to federal treaties, not to actions of states
    * Although some gave up their land willingly, many resisted under Cherokee’s principal chief John Ross, and federal troops were dispatched to move 18,000 Indians to the Oklahoma Territory, the trek labeled as the Trail of Tears (1838), and resulted in the deaths of approx. ¼ of the people

  * American Indians and Florida
    * Whites grew concerned that slaves were escaping to FL and raided FL, this was followed by counterraids by the Seminole and other Indians on communities in Georgia and Alabama
    * This led to the First Seminole War during the War of 1812, and a second Seminole War, and eventually FL coming into America’s hands

  * Indian Territory
    * As part of Indian removal policy, many tribes from east of the Mississippi were relocated to Indian Territory in OK
    * The establishment of an Indian Territory was part of the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834
    * Once in the territory, conflicts broke out between Indian groups indigenous to the area and those relocated there

===== The Development of an American Culture =====

The Emergence of a National Culture

  * This culture developed after the War of 1812 along with nationalist sentiment that borrowed elements of European culture but also sought to create something uniquely American

  * The American Renaissance
    * In the decades before the civil war, there was a high literary spirit
    * Moby Dick, Leaves of Grass, The Scarlet Letter, The House of Seven Gables, and Walden were hallmarks of American literature grappling with questions raised by the Puritans and focusing on the American democratic dream

European Romanticism and American Culture

  * The Romantic Perspective
    * Romanticism was a reaction to industrialization
    * Was deeply nationalistic and reactionary in its embrace of pure national community
    * Challenged rationality and embraced emotion over accuracy

  * Hudson River School
    * The Hudson River School of Painting represented by Thomas Cole, Asher Durand, and Frederic Church painted the Hudson River in a way as to emphasize emotion and the feeling of the moment rather than the accuracy of the image

  * Romanticism in American Literature
    * Many Americans were captivated by British writer Sir Walter Scott, with his larger-than-life heroic figures, who epitomized romanticism in literature
    * In America, Cooper with his “Leatherstocking Tales” including the Last of the Mohicans (1826), captured the danger and fascination of the frontier experienceIrving also published short stories such as Rip Van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow which portrayed a fanciful version of America

===== The Second Great Awakening =====

Religious and Spiritual Movements in Antebellum America

  * The Second Great Awakening
    * At beginning of the 1800s, many clergy members worried that Americans were more captivated by politics than God and Salvation, and Americans felt a yearning for a more immediate religious experience
    * A movement of large camp meetings began in Kentucky and spread to other states - the growing towns along the Erie Canal came to be known as the burned over district because of the intensity of the religious revival
    * Second Great Awakening ministers such as Finney told people they could control their eternal life, much different from predestination, which encouraged individual redemption and even societal reformation
    * It acted as a springboard for a variety of reform movements

  * Mormonism
    * Joseph Smith founded Mormonism in the 1830s growing out of the Second Great Awakening
    * They were a sect that separated themselves from community, and were met with hostility for their unorthodox teachings such as rejecting the trinity or allowing polygamy
    * The group was forced to move from place to place

  * Transcendentalism
    * It was a spiritual and intellectual movement critical of materialism in the US
    * Thoreau wrote about the importance of nature in finding meaning and wrote “Civil Disobedience”, urging people not to acquiesce to unfair and unjust government dictates
    * Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a series of philosophical essays, including “On Self-Reliance”

  * Utopian Communities
    * They were experiments in communal living, structured around a guiding principle and were critical of materialism
    * However, whereas transcendentalists focused on cultivation of the self, utopian communities sought a more collective alternative to society
    * The most well known community was Brook Farm outside of Boston in 1841, started by the transcendentalist George Ripley, and was based on the idea that all people would share equally in the labor and leisure of the community

  * Spiritual Developments in American Indian Communities
    * In the wake of the defeat of the Iroquois Confederacy, a Seneca named Handsome Lake developed a set of spiritual practices that was known as the Longhouse Religion - he spoke out against Indian factionalism, alcohol consumption, and offered many Indians a sense of hope in the face of setbacks

===== An Age of Reform =====

Reform Movements in the Antebellum Period

  * The Temperance Movement
    * The goal was to limit or ban the sale/consumption of alcohol
    * It attracted a large following for many reasons; many women were troubled by the large amount of alcohol consumed by their sons and husbands - not only did husbands come back to their house drunk, they also spent all their money on alcohol and abused their wives and children
    * The American Temperance Society, founded in 1826, was guided by Lyman Beecher’s Six Sermons on the Nature, Occasions, Signs, Evils, and Remedy of Intemperance
    * It claimed 1.5 million members by 1835 and alcohol consumption in the US dropped by about half from 1830-40
    * However, by the 1870s, most “dry states”, states that banned the sale of alcohol, had repealed their prohibition laws

  * The Asylum and Penitentiary Movement
    * Dorothea Dix advocated for the rights of the mentally ill, and created the first mental asylums in the US

  * Public Education
    * Horace Mann, the secretary of the education, led a movement for free public education, which was seen as essential to democratic participation

Debating the Future of Slavery in America

  * Abolitionism
    * The reform spirit of the Second Great Awakening inspired the movement, and although it was a minority opinion among northern whites, it had a major impact on America

  * William Lloyd Garrison and “Immediate Emancipation”
    * In 1831, Garrison began publishing The Liberator, and led the movement for the immediate and uncompensated abolition of slavery, as opposed to gradual emancipation laws
    * Garrison broke with all previous antislavery sentiment in arguing that there should be no compensation for owners, that slaves should be immediately freed, and that they were entitled to the same rights as white people

  * American Colonization Society
    * Founded in 1817 with the goal of transporting Afircan Americans to Africa
    * Some wanted blacks to escape to Africa to escape racism and others wanted them gone because they perceived them as a lower social caste
    * Advocates thought that slaves should not receive treatments as equals in the US, so a colony in Africa called Liberia was created, and 12,000 African Americans were sent there in the antebellum period
    * Some were slaves freed under the condition they leave, and others were free blacks who believed they could succeed in Liberia
    * Frederick Douglass was critical of colonization, and saw it as accommodating slavery instead of ending it

Growing Tensions over Slavery

  * Abolitionism and Electoral Politics
    * The Liberty Party was founded in 1840 by abolitionists, and pushed the idea that the Constitution was against slavery and that the US should live up to its ideals, opposed to Garrison who condemned the Constitution as being pro-slavery

  * Racism and Resistance to the Antislavery Movement
    * White supremacy was central to southern culture, and caused them to believe slavery was necessary and proper
    * It allowed even the poorest whites to feel superior and feel they had something in common to wealthy plantation owners

  * The Lovejoy Incident
    * Elijah Lovejoy was an abolitionist newspaper publisher in Illinois who was killed by a proslavery mob

The Women’s Rights Movement

  * Women in the Public Sphere

    * The Grimke sisters, daughters of prominent SC slave owner, were leaders in the abolitionist cause
    * Mott and Stanton were abolitionists who were banned from the World Anti-Slavery Convention because of their gender, and started rethinking the conditions of women in the US

  * Seneca Falls Convention
    * Stanton and Mott led a group of women in the Seneca Falls Convention to raise the issue of women’s suffrage, and also the structure of gender inequality - property rights, education, wages, child custody, divorce, and overall legal status of women
    * Declaration of Sentiments was issued - “all men and women are created equal”

===== African Americans in the Early Republic =====

Slave Rebellions - The Limits of Anti-Slavery Efforts in the South

  * Unlike plantations in the Carribean, slaves were outnumbered by whites and the whites were well armed

  * Gabriel’s Rebellion
    * In 1800, a blacksmith named Gabriel who was introduced to ideas about republicanism and democracy, planned out a rebellion of 1000 men
    * However, the rebellion was quashed by the Virginia militia before it began due to slaves alerting their owners about the rebellion, and 27 participants were hanged

  * The Denmark Vesey Conspiracy
    * Vesey was charged by local authorities with organizing a plot to destroy Charleston and instigate a broad slave uprising

  * Nat Turner’s Rebellion
    * Turner, a slave preacher, led a rebellion in Southampton County, VA, a band of blacks armed with guns and axes that resulted in the deaths of 55 people
    * The revolt was put down with federal troops, with 100 African Americans being executed by authorities and more were attacked and killed by angry mobs
    * It was the largest rebellion in the 1800s and led to increased fear of slave rebellions and stricter slave laws

The Cultures of African American Communities - Free and Slave

  * David Walker
    * A black who in 1829 issued a pamphlet called “David Walker’s Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World” which called for blacks to resist slavery by any and every means - this pamphlet caused some southern legislatures to enact penalities against anyone caught reading it

  * Frederick Douglass
    * A powerful speaker in the antislavery movement, he wrote Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, and gave the speech”What ot the Slave is the Fourth of July”, criticizing the US for not adhering to its founding principles

  * The African Methodist Episopal (AME) Church
    * Richard Allen in PA in 1816 founded the AME, reflecting the desire of the free black communities to have greater autonomy and tailor the sermons to the experiences of the black community

  * Cultural Resistance to Slavery
    * Slaves developed subtle resistance tactics - passing on stories with the message that the weak often got the better of the strong and creating music to create relief from the work of slavery

===== The Society of the South in the Early Republic =====

Slavery and the Southern “Way of Life”

  * Southern Defense of Slavery
    * Some contrasted slavery with harsh factories in the north and the lack of care for their employees
    * George Fitshugh was critical of the free labor ideology, the idea that workers of the north could earn money to buy land and become independent of others, and said that it masked a heartless approach to the world
    * Others said the Bible sanctioned slavery, or that it was a positive good for slavery because it provided them with skills, discipline, and civilization

  * Biblical Defense of Slavery
    * Cited passages that said slaves should be submissive to their masters
    * The Curse of Ham was central to the biblical defense of slavery, where Noah told Ham that his descendants would be slaves

  * The “Mudsill Theory”
    * Some argued that the existence of slaves was necessary, such as a mudsill supports a house, the institution of slavery prevented a class of poor, landless people undermining civilization

Cotton, Slavery, and the Southern Exception

  * Cotton and Slavery
    * In 1807, Britain outlawed international slave trade and the US followed suit in the year after
    * All of the northern states had voted to abolish slavery outright or gradually, but slavery and cotton were the main engines behind American economic growth in the first half of the nineteenth century

  * Slavery and the Culture of the South
    * A large slave population had an impact on shaping southern culture - the language, food, music, and dialect
    * White supremacy took a strong hold in the South, more than in the North where, although there was white supremacy, it lacked the intensity of the South without any black population in the North

Westward Expansion and the Politics of Slavery

  * Expansion into Texas - From Settlement to Independence
    * Mexico was eager to attract settlers to provide a buffer from Indian raiding parties
    * Led by Sephen Austin, settlers were attracted to Texas because of the abundance of land that could be sued for cotton cultivations
    * Mexico allowed these settlers a degree of self government, but tensions grew in the 1830s as a result of Texans bringing slaves, which was banned in Mexico
    * General Santa Anna sought to bring them into Mexican law and custom, and in 1835, the Texans rebelled - many of whom were Spanish speaking Tejanos who objected to being ruled by Mexico City
    * Although the rebels almost lost 200 defending the Alamo and 400 in the Goliad, under the General Houston, they were able to win independence from Mexico, establishing the Republic of Texas in 1836

  * Annexation of Texas and the Politics of Slavery
    * Many Texans were eager for the Lone Star Republic to join the United States
    * However, Jackson, not wanting to add to tensions by admitting a large slave state, blocked annexation, and this was continued by Van Buren and Harrison
    * President Tyler supported the annexation but did not have the support to make this a reality, but managed to push it through to Congress at the end of his presidency

===== Subject to Debate =====

  * Was it an Era of Good Feelings
    * Some note the beginnings of divisions ofer the issue of slavery, and others on class divisions that emerged when the master-apprentice system gave way to the wage-labor system

  * The Legacy of President Jacksoin
    * In the latter 1800s, he was scoffed at by historians who came from elite New England - he seemed arrogant, ignorant, and authoritarian
    * By the early 1900s, Progressive-era historians saw Jackson as a man of the pioneer era who brought the democratic, frontier spirit with him to the White House
    * More recently, historians draw parallels between Jackson’s expansionist impulses and American foreign adventures from Vietnam to Iraq
      * The Indian Removal Act and the Trail of Tears left a permanent stain on his legacy

  * The Antebellum Period and the Advent of Social History
    * Social history has become more prominent, and the focus on what life was like for ordinary Americans

  * Reform Movements - Democratic or Restrictive?
    * The temperance movement reflects the more restrictive aspect of reform movements
    * The women’s rights movement and abolitionist movement were democratic
    * The push for public education can be seen in both lights - a prerequisite for meaningful participation in the democratic process, but also an opportunity for learning to impose a rigid set of middle class Protestant values on a diverse working class

  * The Impact of Westward Expansion
    * The era of manifest destiny is often shrouded in the language of idealism, democracy, adventure, and optimism, but if carried out in other countries, would be seen in a negative light such as Napoleon’s conquest or the brutality of Japanese conquest

  * Historians and the Brutality of Slavery
    * Time on the Cross, published in 1974, asserts that while slavery was immoral, it was an efficient business model that was less brutal towards slaves than history would make it out to be
    * However, their data and methods are often challenged by other historians

===== Period 5 =====

===== Manifest Destiny =====

Westward Migrations

  * Americans Respond to the Call of Manifest Destiny
    * Manifest destiny refers to the movement of individuals to the west and to the political extension of United States territory - it was the destiny of the United States to expand westward and its power in the Western Hemisphere
    * Coined by John O’Sullivan - it was God’s plan that the US take over and populate the land from coast to coast - but most Americans moved west out of economic desires rather than a desire to fulfill a divine plan

  * Overland Trails
    * Most famous trail to the west was the Oregon Trail - a 2,000 mile route from Missouri to the Pacific
    * Santa Fe Trail, California Trail
    * Approx. 300,000 people traveled these trails
    * Story of the Donner Party (1846-7) is often repeated - a wagon train of 87 migrants became snowbound in the Sierra Nevada mountains, of which 48 were rescued
    * However, the death rate on these trails was only slightly higher than average death rates, with Indians more likely to work as guides and trade than be bandits

  * The California Gold Rush
    * Discovery of gold at Sutter’s Mill in CA in 1848 - the year that California became a US territory
    * Many migrated in 1849, termed the 49ers, however, very few common people could make profit with gold which required heavy machinery to strike

  * The Mormon Exodus
    * The Mormons, who had migrated to Utah as a result of religious persecution, arrived in Utah during the Mexican War and Utah became US territory

The Ideological Foundations of Manifest Destiny

  * Manifest Destiny and Race
    * Americans came to believe that other people that inhabited North America were incapable of establishing a democratic government which justified their westward expansion
    * This came from European Romanticism and scientific racialism which held that whites were superior to other races, fueling the American belief that they were superior to the savage tribes of the west

  * The Spread of Democratic Civilization
    * Justified manifest destiny by asserting the superiority of American democratic practices - conquest of Mexico was seen as a victory of liberty-loving Protestants over tyrannical and anti-republican Catholics

Government Promotion of Western Expansion

  * The Morrill Land Grant Act (1826)
    * Promoted secondary public education in the West - the USFG transferred substantial tracts of its lands to the states so they could build public colleges or sell the land to fund the building of educational facilities

  * Pacific Railroad Act (1862)
    * Extended government bonds and tracts of land to companies engaged in building transcontinental railroads

  * The Homestead Act (1862)
    * Provided free land in the region to settlers who were willing to farm it - passed with the absence of Democrats from Congress during the Civil War
    * Many people applied for and were granted homesteads, however, many did not have farming skills and went bankrupt, and it became increasingly difficult for ordinary farmers to compete with large-scale agricultural operations

Economic Expansion Beyond the Western Hemisphere: The United States and Asia

  * Opening Trade with Japan
    * Commodore Matthew C. Perry used gunboat diplomacy to open up Japan and secure a treaty that made American trade with Japan possible

===== The Mexican-American War =====

The Mexican War and Westward Expansion

  * The Election of 1844 and the Annexation of Texas
    * Polk wanted to push for Texas annexation, and even before he became president, Tyler passed a Texas’s annexation to Congress before he left
    * It joined the US as the 15th slave state in 1845

  * Origins of the War with Mexico
    * Polk and other expansionists were eager to incorporate the remainder of Mexico’s northern provinces into the US, and tensions brought the two nations to a dispute over the southern border of Texas
    * In 1846, skirmishes in the disputed area led to war between US and Mexico

  * Victory over Mexico on the Battlefield
    * The US won early battles in the Mexican-American War (1846-48), and although Mexico was determined to win, they surrendered when the US captured Mexico City

  * The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
    * Mexico signed this treaty, giving up the disputed territory in Texas and giving up California and New Mexico in the Mexican Cession for $15 million - including modern-day CA, NE, UT, AZ, NM, CO, WY

  * Gadsden Purchase
    * Acquired from Mexico in 1853, 5 years after the Mexican war, it added more area ot the US and was sought by the US as a possible southern route for a transcontinental railroad

  * The Acquisition of the Mexican Cession and the Slavery Question
    * The question of whether slavery would exist in the new territories continued to generate national controversy

Conflict on the Frontier Following the Mexican-American War

  * Expansion and Violence on the Frontier
    * The trails that took settlers west to the Oregon territory passed straight through Indian lands and the Indian Territory where Indians had been relocated
    * This caused the government to begin taking control of Indian lands and restrict them to reservations

  * The Growth of the Reservation System
    * The Indian Appropriations Act of 1851 established reservations in present-day OK, and the goal of the reservation system was to keep American Indians off lands that white settlers wanted to settle
    * In exchange, Indians were promised a degree of autonomy as well as annuities
    * The system reduced Indian land from 15 to 1.5 million acres, and the land was incapable of farming, reducing many to poverty

  * The Treaty of Fort Laramie
    * Indians resisted further encroachments into the Great Plains, so in 1851, US representatives and 10,000 Plain Indians convened in Fort Laramie where they agreed that Indians provide a way for wagons to reach the far west in exchange for the promise that remaining Indian lands would be untouched

  * The Great Sioux Uprising (1862)
    * When settlers refused to honor the Treaty of Fort Laramie, Sioux Indians led by Chief Little Crow killed a thousand settlers before being put down by the military

  * The Colorado War and the Sand Creek Massacre (1864)
    * The migration west continued during the civil war
    * The Colorado War (1864-65) was fought between the US/Colorado militia, against the Southern Cheyenne, Arapaho, and allied Brule and Oglala Sioux (Lakota) people in Colorado
    * Included the Sand Creek Massacre - after a settler family was killed by Indians, Colonel Chivington led an attack on a peaceful Cheyenne village killing 150-50 women and children

  * American Indians in the Mexican Cession
    * Disease took lives of thousands
    * Systematic campaigns of extermination against Indians caused a genocide, and as the 1850s progressed, thousands of Indians were either murdered or enslaved

===== The Compromise of 1850 =====

Territorial Acquisition and the Slavery Question

  * The Wilmot Proviso
    * Americans reached an uneasy truce on slavery with the Missouri Compromise in 1820
    * Northern politicians put forth the Wilmot Proviso (1846), which would ban slavery in territories that would be gained in the Mexican American War
    * The proposal failed to pass the Senate

  * The Election of 1848 and the Free-Soil Party
    * Both the Whigs and Democrats avoided taking strong stands on the issue of slavery
    * Antislavery men in both parties founded the Free-Soil Party in 1848 which only got about 5-10% of the vote, but many of its members would later join the Republican Party (1854)

  * Popular Sovereignty
    * Senator Lewis Cass proposed the idea that slavery should be left to the people of that territory
    * Southerners wanted the vote on slavery to happen later, as it would give slavery more time to develop, whereas Northerners wanted it to happen earlier

  * Cuba and the Ostend Manifesto
    * Polk offered to purchase Cuba from Spain, but Spain refused
    * Later, American diplomats were sent to Belgium by President Pierce to secretly buy Cuba - their goals, written up as the Ostend Manifesto, provoked anger from northern politicians who saw this as an attempt to expand the slavery empire beyond the ConUS

California Application for Statehood

  * California and the Compromise of 1850
    * Californians wrote up a constitution in which slavery would be illegal, which the Southern senators objected to - Clay and the Senate worked out the Compromise of 1850 in which CA would be admitted as a free state and there would be a harsher fugitive slave law
    * Although they did not pass as an omnibus (jumbo) bill, bills allowing NM and UT to decide slavery based on popular sovereignty, accepting a new boundary between Texas and Mexico, and banning the slave trade (but not slavery) in Washington all passed individually

===== Sectional Conflict: Regional Differences =====

The North and Immigration

  * Irish Immigration and the Five Points
    * The largest destination for Irish immigrants was the Five Points neighborhood of NYC
    * It was the worst in terms of density, disease, child mortality, unemployment, prostitution, and violent crime, but it was the original American melting pot, combining elements of the black commmunity and the Irish community
    * Mulatto was a term coined for intermarriage between the blacks and Irish

Anti-Immigrant Sentiment in the Antebellum Period

  * A strong anti-Catholic nativist movement developed in the US to limit the rights, political power and cultural influence of newly arrived immigrants

  * Nativism
    * Many Americans thought that the new immigrants who were mostly non-Protestnat, lacked the self-control of proper middle-class Protestant Americans - evidenced by excessive drinking culture

  * The Know Nothings
    * The Know-Nothing Party was a political wing of an anti-Catholic, anti-Irish movement, and achieved electoral success in mainly the Northeast

Differing Economic Models: The Free Labor Ideal Versus the Slave System

  * The economy of the North was increasingly focused on a free-labor model with manufacturing industries, whereas the economy of the South was increasingly dependent on a slave-labor, agricultural economy

  * North population grew fast while South population was slow

Abolitionism in the North - Strategies and Tactics

  * The Fugitive Slave Act and Personal Liberty Laws
    * Many northerners grew alarmed at the enforcement of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act in the Compromise of 1850 which allowed slave catchers to bring the brutality of the slave system to northern cities
    * In response, northern states passed personal liberty laws, offering protection to fugitives
    * Prigg v. Pennsylvania - SCOTUS overturned the conviction of slave catcher Edward Prigg on the grounds that federal law was superior to state law
    * Ableman v. Booth - SCOTUS affirmed the legality of the Fugitive Slave Act

  * Uncle Tom’s Cabin
    * Written by Harriet Beecher Stowe depicted the brutality of slavery - this caused northerners to humanize slaves

  * John Brown and the Raid on Harper’s Ferry
    * In 1859, Brown carried out a raid to acquire weapons from a federal armory in Harper’s Ferry, VA, with intention to distribute the weapons to slaves, which would cause a massive slave rebellion
    * They were stopped with reinforcements led by Robert E. Lee
    * This convinced southerners that there was a northern conspiracy to overthrow slavery, although in reality, Brown’s act was condemned by northern politicians

The Southern Response to the Slavery Question

  * Racism and the Defense of Slavery
    * In the first half of the 1800s, the defense of slavery shifted
    * It went from a necessary evil to a positive good

  * Racism and Culture
    * There was a growing popularity of minstrel shows, where whites would perform variety shows in blackface - portraying blacks as lazy, shiftless, dim-witted, and happy-go-lucky
    * Southern slave-owners became increasingly interested in the religious practices of their slaves, and they built churches on their plantations - ministers would point out that Hebrews owned slaves or that slavery was not condemned by Jesus

===== Failure to Compromise =====

The Deterioration of Relations Between the North and the South

  * The Kansas-Nebraska Act
    * In 1854, Senator Douglass introduced this Act to the Senate - calling for dividing the Northern section of the Louisiana Purchase into Kansas and Nebraska and allowing for slavery there - however those areas were closed by the Missouri Compromise and they ended up being left to popular sovereignty
    * Many were upset at the act and at Douglass

  * Bleeding Kansas
    * Violence erupted as pro and anti-slavery men fought for control of the state
    * Thousands of pro-slavery Missourians came over the border to vote for Kansas to be a slave state
    * In response, each side wrote up a constitution for Kansas - anti-slavery with the Topeka Constitution and pro-slavery with the Lecompton Constitution
    * President Pierce recognized the pro-slavery government
    * A pro-slavery group of Missourians attakced the anti-slavery town of Lawrence in 1856
    * John Brown, a deeply religious anti-slavery activist, along with his sons and several followers, killed five pro-slavery men with swords along the Pottawatomie Creek
    * This was a precursor to the Civil War

  * The Beating of Senator Charles Sumner
    * He gave a pointed anti-slavery speech called Crimes against Kansas, where he singled out Senator Butler of SC, and when Butler’s nephew heard the news, he beat Sumner with a cane - Northerners saw this as a sign of southern barbarity, southerners made his nephew a hero

  * The Dred Scott Decision
    * Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) - Dred Scott had been living in Illinois/Wisconsin where slavery was banned by the Northwest Ordinance, however upon returning to Missouri, they were to return to slavery
    * He sued on the basis that they were free because they had once lived in free areas - however, SCOTUS ruled that Scott was still a slave and could not initiate a lawsuit, and they ruled that Congress did not have the authority to declare the northern portion of the Louisiana Purchase free
    * The decision, therefore, invalidated the Missouri Compromise
    * SCOTUS also declared that no blacks, even if they were free, could be citizens because they were beings of an inferior order - this indicated to northerners that slavery was a national, rathern than sectional, institution, and that Congress could do little to stop it

The Death of the Second Two-Party System

  * Party Realignment
    * The Whigs were divided between proslavery Cotton Whigs and anti-slavery Conscience Whigs
    * The Democratic Party became increasingly a regional southern, proslavery party

  * The Republican Party and the Free-Labor Ideal
    * In 1854, former members of the Know-Nothing Party, Conscience Whigs, abolitionists, and former Democrats formed the Republican Party to uphold the free labor ideology - upheld civic virtue and the dignity of labor with an emphasis on economic growth and social mobility
    * It defended a system that allowed hard-working individuals to achieve independence and property
    * Though the party was critical of slavery, it did not advocate abolition but simply that slavery should not be allowed to spread to new territories

  * The Election of 1856
    * This made it clear that the two-party system was over, and the Republican party emerged as a major party over the Whig Party dissolved
    * The Democratic Party won the election by picking a northern candidate who had southern sympathies, James Buchanan, who could get both northern and southern supporters

===== Election of 1860 and Secession =====

The Election of 1860 and the Secession Crisis

  * The Election of 1860
    * The Democratic Party was divided between a northern wing and a southern wing
    * The northern Democrats rallied around popular sovereignty whereas the southern Democrats strongly endorsed slavery
    * The Constitutional Union endorsed maintaining the Union and avoiding the slavery issue
    * The Republican Party chose Abraham Lincoln

  * Lincoln’s Electoral Victory in 1860
    * His debates with Stephen Douglas for the Illinois Senate seat popularized him and he asked Douglas whether he favored the spread of slavery - to which he responded that he would put forth popular sovereignty
    * When he ran for president, he indicated that he could not tamper with slavery where it already existed, but promised to block slavery’s expansion to the West
    * When he won presidency, southern slaveholders were unsatisfied because slavery needed to expand to remain economically viable, and even before he was inagurated, 7 southern states seceded

  * The Onset of War
    * Lincoln did not permit southern secession, but did not want to start a war
    * The presence of US troops at Fort Sumter was the spark of the war - the Confederacy decided they would not tolerate the US flag at Fort Sumter, and in 1861, Confederate president Jefferson Davis ordered the bombardment of the fort
    * Lincoln rallied 75,000 troops after the surrender of Fort Sumter, and the two sides were at war

===== Military Conflict in the Civil War =====

Mobilizing for War

  * Industrialization
    * The Civil War spurred rapid industrialization of the North as the Union required a large amount of war materials - guns, bullets, boots, uniforms
    * Manufacturers rapidly began modernizing production, and industrialization stimulated a long period of economic growth, turning the US into a world economic power
    * People like Carnegie, Rockefeller, Gould, JP Morgan, and Armour began their economic rise through supplying the Union war effort

  * Funding the war
    * The US funded the war in 3 ways - issuing currency, borrowing money, and levying taxes - which greatly expanded the scope of the federal government
    * Congress issued 3 Legal Tender Acts in 1862 and 1863 which allowed the government to issue paper currency, “greenbacks” - money that was not backed by gold or silver but by the people’s faith in the government
    * Congress passed a series of National Bank Acts which created a national banking system - allowing existing banks to join the system and issue US Treasury notes as currency - providing stability to the banking/currency system when there was no national bank (the Federal Reserve was not created until 1913)
    * The government appealed to the public to purchase bonds, being lent about $400 million by the people and loaned $2.6 billion during the war by banks and other financial institutions
    * The government created a wide array of taxes, and for the first time, an income tax - tax rates remained modest during the war in the face of widespread public opposition

  * NYC Draft Riots
    * Protests broke out against the wartime draft in NYC in 1863
    * People were especially upset about a law that allowed draftees to be able to pay $300 to escape serving
    * Blacks were frequently a scapegoat, accused of taking jobs from whites

  * Civil Liberties and Home Front Opposition
    * Lincoln suspended habeas corpus, authorizing the arrest of rebels and traitors without due process in order to respond to riots and threats of militia action in the border state of Maryland
    * In 1863, Congress passed the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act to support this move by the president

Turning the Tide: Factors in the Union victory

  * Strengths and Weaknesses of the Two Sides
    * Union advantages:
      * Greater population (much of the southern population was slaves)
      * Greater military capacity
      * More diverse economy
      * Extensive railroad network
      * This allowed the Union to resupply its troops and bring reinforcements as the war dragged on
    * Confederacy advantages:
      * Fighting a defensive war
      * Did not have to invade the North to win, just had to fight on home soil
      * South’s rich military tradition - had able generals and a cohort of military men to draw from

  * Fighting the Civil War
    * Union’s 3 part strategy
      * The navy would blockade southern ports - the Anaconda Plan - to prevent supplies from reaching the South and blockade southern products from being shipped abroad
      * Divide Confederate territory in half by taking control of the Mississippi River
      * Then, troops would march on the confederate capital of Richmond, VA to achieve victory
    * The Union believed the war would be quick and easy, but these illusions were shattered at the First Battle of Bull Run where Confederate troops forced Union troops to retreat
    * Lincoln went through many generals before settling on Ulysses S. Grant
    * The Union suffered defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Fredericksburg, and other battles
    * The 1862 Battle of Antietam repelled a Confederate invasion and was considered a slight Union Victory
    * A fight broke out between two ships, the Confederate Merrimac and the US Monitor which ended in a draw, but pointed at the future of naval battles
    * The Union managed successfully blockade the South, and the South attempted to use King Cotton Diplomacy, putting an embargo on shipping cotton to Britain in hopes that it might force British factories to come to a halt and for Britain to aid the Confederacy, however, this only hurt the Confederacy
    * The Union blockade prevented the Confederacy from selling surplus cotton on the world market, and a negotiation with Britain ensured the Union that they would stay on the sidelines
    * **Turning point** in the war was the Battle of Gettysburg, after which, the Confederacy was now on the retreat
    * The Union victory at Vicksburg, MS, allowed the Union to gain control of the Mississippi river
    * In 1864, General Sherman’s March to the Sea from Atlanta to Charleston was a military campaign designed to destroy the morale of Southern civilians through burning houses, raiding and looting villages, and making life so unpleasant for Georgia’s civilians that they would plead to end the war
    * Confederate general Robert E. Lee finally surrendered to Grant at the Appomattox Courthouse, VA in 1865

===== Government Policies During the Civil War =====

The Focus of the War: From Union to Emancipation

  * President Lincoln and Slavery
    * Lincoln, with the help of abolitionists, Radical Republicans, and free blacks and slaves helped to issue emancipation while guiding the country through a devastating war
    * He was able to convince a reluctant country that ending slavery was consistent with basic American values

  * The Confiscation Acts (1861)
    * Congress passed them in 1861 and 1862 - the first declared that any slaves working for the Confederacy could be taken as contraband of war, and the second allowed for the seizure of slaves owned by Confederate officials

  * The Emancipation Proclamation (1862)
    * He waited until the Union had achieved victory on the battlefield, and when the Union repelled an invasion at Antietam, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation on September 1862
    * This ordered the freeing of all slaves in **Confederate territory**
    * It did not free slaves in Union territory, but it made it clear that this was just as much a war for the liberation of the slaves as it was a war to preserve the Union

Lincoln and the Meaning of the Civil War

  * The Gettysburg Address and the Transition Toward a Modern Nation
    * His address at Gettysburg framed the Civil War in the larger context of fulfilling the US’s democratic goals
    * He stated that the US was conceived in Liberty and that all men are created equal
    * The Civil War, to Lincoln, was a test of whether a nation conceived around the principles of liberty and equality could last
    * The war made it clear that the states did not have the autonomy to secede - and after the war, the US was increasingly referred to as a nation, rather than just a union of states

===== Reconstruction =====

The Expansion of Citizenship Following the Civil War

  * The 13th Amendment (1865)
    * By the end of the Civil War, some slaves were not freed, especially in KY and TX
    * This freed the remaining slaves and put in the Constitution that slavery was illegal in America

  * The 14th Amendment (1868)
    * Asserted that all people born in the US are citizens
    * Stated that no citizens shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law
    * The southern states were forced to accept this before they could regain representation in Congress
    * The amendment undid long-held custom and the Dred-Scott decision, putting blacks on an equal footing with whites and providing a guarantee of equality before the law, and although it did not guarantee blacks the right to vote, for every male who was denied the vote, the state would be forced to deduct a person from its total population count

  * The 15th Amendment (1869)
    * Granted black men voting rights, stating that the vote may not be denied to someone based on race color or previous condition of servitude

The Women’s Rights Movement and the Constitution

  * Debates over the 15th Amendment
    * Many were upset that the 14th Amendment specifically included the word male as before, suffragists could argue that the Constitution did not say anything about women not being able to vote
    * Stanton and Susan B. Anthony refused to support the 15th Amendment because it did not include women
    * Others, led by Lucy Stone and husband Henry Blackwell, although disappointed, argued that it was important to support the Reconstruction and the Republican Party
    * Stanton and Anthony formed the National Woman Suffrage Association and Stone formed the American Woman Suffrage Association in 1869, both of which merged in 1890 to become the National American Woman Suffrage Association

The Limited Successes of Reconstruction

  * Reconstruction refers to the process of reuniting the national following the Civil War

  * It resulted in some short term successes, a shift in power from the executive branch to Congress, but the successes were short lived

  * Approaches to Reconstruction
    * What accommodations would be made for freed slaves?
    * How would the South be reintegrated?
    * Would there be any punishments for secessionists?

  * Wartime Reconstruction
    * In 1863, he announced the ten percent plan which if 10% of the voting population in a southern state took an oath of allegiance to the US, they could establish a new government and send representatives to Congress
    * He vetoed the Wade-Davis bill which would’ve raised the bar to 50%
    * In his second inaugural address, he announced the wanted to reunite the country with malice toward none, with charity for all - he wanted to end the war as soon as possible

  * Presidential Reconstruction
    * After Lincoln’s assassination, his VP Andrew Johnson assumed power
    * He had no affinity for the Republican Party, nor emancipation and black equality
    * He quickly recognized the new southern state governments as legitimate after they ratified the new Amendments
    * In the South, many members of the old slave-owning class were now back in power who tried to pass the Black Codes, and southern postwar conditions were so similar to prewar conditions that many northerners wondered if they had “won the war but lost the peace”

  * Black Codes
    * These were a set of laws passed by Southern states to regulate blacks and recreate the conditions of slavery
    * They forbade blacks from owning land or businesses, and vagrancy laws allowed for the arrest of blacks for infractions such as not having a certain amount of money while being on a public road
    * Punishments for violations of Black Codes included forcing blacks to labor on a plantation for a period of time

  * Congress and the President Clash over Reconstruction
    * In 1866, tensions increased between Johnson and congressional Republicans
    * Johnson vetoed an extension of Freedman’s Bureau and a Civil Rights Act that were designed to overturn the Black Codes
      * Freedman’s Bureau was established by Congress to provide practical aid to 4,000,000 newly freed black slaves in their transition from slavery to freedom
    * The biggest fight was over the Fourteenth Amendment - Johnson took an active role in urging Southerners to reject the amendment which he saw as further congressional interference in Reconstruction

  * Radical Reconstruction
    * Johnson tried to mobilize white voters against the Fourteenth Amendment in the 1866 midterms, however, the strategy backfired and Republicans won a resounding victory
    * They embarked on more sweeping measures, and this phase of Reconstruction (Radical Reconstruction) showed the potential of a biracial democracy in the US

  * Reconstruction Acts of 1867
    * These divided the South into 5 military districts which could rejoin the US only if they guaranteed basic rights to blacks and accept the 14th Amendment, however, they could not fully carry out their program
    * Rep. Stevens introduced a bill that would grant freed men 40 acres of land, however, this went against the Republican value of protecting private property and died in the summer of the year it was introduced (1867)

  * The Impeachment of President Johnson
    * The tensions grew so large that the House impeached Johnson for violating the Tenure of Office Act
    * Although he was eventually found not guilty, it rendered him powerless to stop Congress’s Reconstruction plans

  * The Composition of Reconstruction Governments
    * Democrats still served in state legislatures, often in the minority
    * The Republicans were made up of different groups - Southern whites who joined were termed scalawags by their Democratic opponents, and they were former Whigs who sought to promote economic progress for the South
    * Many northerners came to the South to participate in Reconstruction, some for economic reasons termed carpetbaggers, but some to help freed slaves adjust to free life
    * Many Republican legislatures were African Americans, and in the 1870s, 2 blacks were elected to the Senate with more than a dozen in the House

  * The Record of Reconstruction Governments
    * White southerners accused the Reconstruction government of corruption and ineptitude, however, modern historians pointed out that they accomplished a great deal against all odds
    * They established schools for African Americans such as Howard University and Morehouse College, and they established hospitals that served the black community, rewrote constitutions, updated penal codes, and began the physical rebuilding of the war-torn South

  * The Waning of the Reconstruction
    * Southern conservative Democrats called redeemers aggressively sought to regain power - aided by networks of white terrorist organizations that used violence to silence African Americans and intimidate them from participating in public life
    * In Colfax, LA, both a Democratic and Republican candidate claimed victory, and in early 1873, the Republican candidate and his slate of appointees occupied a courthouse in Colfax, defended by armed blacks
    * A large group of white insurgents, including Klan members, attacked the courthouse, killing over 100 blacks and taking over the building
    * The violence was legally challenged in United States v. Cruikshank, SCOTUS ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870, which enabled the constitutional rights of blacks to be protected, was unconstitutional, a decision that weakened Reconstruction
    * This caused many northern whites to lose interest in reforming the South and redirected their interest to the industrial development of the North

  * The Formal End of Reconstruction: The Election of 1876
    * Although Tilden won the majority of the popular vote, neither him nor Rutherford B. Hayes were able to claim enough electoral votes to be declared the winner
    * A special electoral commission declared Hayes the winner in three contested states which was protested by Democrats
    * The Compromise of 1877 allowed Hayes to win the presidency, but Republicans agreed to end Reconstruction, paving the way for rule by Democratic Party in the South

===== Failure of Reconstruction =====

From Slavery to Sharecropping

  * The Development of the Sharecropping System
    * Plantation owners wanted to hire groups of blacks to work for them, but blacks wanted their own plot - “forty acres and a mule”
    * Blacks began to rent land by paying half of their yearly crop to the land owner - this sharecropping system was a compromise - blacks did not have to work under supervision while white plantation owners acquired cotton to be sold on the open market
    * After paying back loans, black farmers were left very little, creating a cycle of debt which prevented blacks from acquiring wealth and owning land

Conflicts Over Notions of Citizenship and American Identity

  * Segregation in the South
    * Jim Crow laws were a series of segregation laws passed in the southern states, segregating public facilities such as railroad cars, bathrooms, and schools, relegating blacks to second-class status

  * The Supreme Court and the Narrowing of the 14th Amendment
    * Advocates for black civil rights hoped that the 14th Amendment would prevent the implementation of Jim Crow laws
    * However, SCOTUS interpreted privileges or immunities in a broad language that it allowed for Jim Crow laws
    * In the Slaughterhouse cases, the Court made a distinction between national citizenship and state citizenship
    * In Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), SCOTUS asserted that racial segregation did not violate equal protection guaranteed by the 14th Amendment

  * The Exclusion of African Americans from Political Process
    * Literacy tests and poll taxes limited their ability to vote
    * Poor whites got around these rules with the grandfather clause - guaranteeing a man the right to vote if he or his father or grandfather had the right to vote before the Civil War
    * Moreover, the Democratic Party often held whites only primaries, and African Americans who spoke out against this were targets of violence and murder - KKK formed in 1866

  * A Second Reconstruction
    * Reconstruction lasted only a decade and many of its accomplishments were short lived, however, these failures prompted a second reconstruction with civil rights activists in the 20th century

===== Subject to Debate =====

  * Slavery and the Question of Civil War Causation

  * What are the causes of the Civil War?
    * Southern partisans blame the North for interfering with their domestic institutions
    * Northern partisans blame the Dred Scott decision, the beating of Senator Sumner, and the defense of slavery as inflexibility on the part of the South

  * Historians saw the war as an irrepressible conflict - inevitable because of slavery and conflicts because of free labor ideology

  * Was this even a war around slavery? Or was it just between a capitalist industrial North and an agrarian, almost feudal south?

  * The Myth of the “Lost Cause”

  * It holds that the Confederate cause was a noble and honorable one, and that the south only lost because of the overwhelming forces of the north

  * However, this ignores the centrality of the slavery question

  * Viewing the Reconstruction Period in Context

  * Traditional historians criticize the Republican Party for imposing crushing burdens on the South, occupying it with troops, and saddling it with inept and corrupt government

  * However, recent historians emphasize the progress made by blacks under Reconstruction, helping to inspire civil rights activists in the 20th century

  * Roosevelt = Theodore Roosevelt, FDR = Franklin Roosevelt, LBJ = Lyndon B. Johnson

===== Period 6 =====

===== Westward Expansion: Economic Development =====

Mechanization and the Transformation of American Agriculture

  * The Impact of Mechanization
    * During the decades following the Civil War, machines such as the mechanical reaper and the combine harvester replaced hand-held tools
    * Production of corn and wheat more than doubled between 1870-1900
    * Undermined small-scale family farms as mechanization lowered the prices farmers received per bushel of corn or wheat, and most farmers could not afford the new equipment
    * Agriculture changed from small-scale farms with laborers → large scale mechanized operations
    * Many smaller farms went out of business

Agrarian Resistance in the Face of Structural Change

  * Debt and Dependence in the Gilded Age
    * Farmers struggled in all areas
    * Railroad companies were overcharging farmers for carrying produce to Chicago and other destination
    * Tight supply of currency in the US made it hard for farmers to pay off debt, and it drove down the prices they received for their crops
    * Banks were foreclosing (take possession of a mortgaged property as a result of failure to keep up their mortgage payments) on farms

  * The Greenback Party
    * A political formation that sought an expansion of the currency supply
    * Founded in 1878, following the Panic of 1873, they advocated for paper money not backed by gold or silver, but public trust in the government like how it was done during the Civil War
    * Although the party disbanded, the call for expanding the money supply was taken up again in the panic of 1893

  * The Grange and Granger Laws
    * National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry (Grange), is a farmers’ organization that pushed for state laws to protect farmers’ interests
    * Founded in 1867, it led the fight to pass laws that regulated railroad freight rates and made certain abusive corporate practices illegal - Granger Laws
    * Munn v. Illinois (1877), SCOTUS asserted it was within the government’s powers to regulate private industry
    * Wabash v. Illinois (1886), SCOTUS reversed itself and ruled that states could not regulate railroads because they cross state lines

  * Protecting Communal Lands of the Southwestern Hispanos
    * Clashes occurred in the 1880s-90s between recently arriving settlers from older states and long-time Mexican and American Indian occupants of the land
    * Large portions of these lands were used communally by the local Hispano population (the name given to people of colonial Spanish descent)
    * By the 1890s, the Hispanos and Indians had lost more than 90% of their land and began organizing resistance
    * Groups such as Las Gorras Blancas and Las Manos Negras led raids on settler land - cutting fences and burning property
    * Ultimately, varied tactics of the movement failed to regain lost lands

Transportation, Communication, and the Opening of New Markets in the West

  * Land Grants to Railroads
    * In the second half of the 1800s, the USFG encouraged economic growth by subsidizing improvements in transportation and communications, encouraging the building of railroad lines
    * Cost of goods came down and standard of living of Americans rose
    * The Pacific Railway Act of 1862 caused land grants given by the government for new rail lines to be built to go straight to railroad corporations rather than to states
    * 175 million acres - generated huge profits for railroad companies, bringing in about $435 million

  * The Telegraph and the Telephone
    * The telegraph network (developed before the Civil War) continued to spread throughout the Gilded Age
    * First transatlantic cable was laid in 1858
    * Alexander Graham Bell was granted a patent for the telephone in 1876 and established the Bell Telephone Company
    * By the end of 1880, almost 50,000 telephones were in use in the United States

Promoting Westward Expansion - Government Policies, Railroads, and Mining Operations

  * Government Policies and Westward Expansion
    * Congress continued the Homestead Act of 1862, but they discovered that the land it granted - 160 acres - was too small
    * So Congress passed the Timber Culture Act (1873) to allow homesteaders to receive additional lands if they agreed to plant trees on a portion of it and the Desert Land Act (1877), offering acreage for a discounted price if the recipients agreed to irrigate the land

  * Government Support for Transcontinental Railroads
    * The Pacific Railroad Acts, passed in 1860s, promoted government bonds and land grants to railroad companies to complete rail lines to the Pacific Ocean
    * The completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit, UT in 1869 was a milestone in connecting the country
    * Four additional transcontinental lines were completed in the coming decades, the last one, the Great Northern Railway (1893), was privately build without the benefit of federal land grants
    * Western railroad companies relentlessly promoted land sales (from the land grants they had) to the populations of the overcrowded cities of the East

  * Mining Operations in the West
    * Gold in CA (1848), silver in Nevada’s Comstock Lode (1859) → Virginia City was established as a result, gold at Pikes Peak (1869) → Denver City and Boulder City
    * Similar rushes occurred in ND, SD, MO, AZ, UT, ID
    * While a few did cash in on the precious metal, most did not
    * Most of the mining was done by large mining firms with expensive equipment → investors enjoying substantial profits, shares being traded on international markets, and wage workers replacing prospectors

===== Westward Expansion: Social and Cultural Development =====

Settling the West

  * Chinese Communities in the West
    * Chinese immigrants were initially drawn to North America by the gold rush in CA
    * By 1865, 20,000 Chinese immigrants had moved; by 1870, over 63,000 lived in America
    * White Californians pushed for laws to exclude them from mining - 1852 Foreign Miners’ License Tax
    * Discrimination, legal obstacles, and changes in the economics of mining pushed most Chinese immigrants away from mining and towards other jobs
    * They made up 90% of the workforce who helped complete the first transcontinental railroad

  * Anti-Asian Sentiment and the Chinese Exclusion Act
    * 1854 California Supreme Court the People of the State of California v. George W. Hall ruled the Chinese Americans could not testify against whites in court → impossible to prosecute crimes of whites against Chinese Americans
    * Many californians blamed the Chinese for the Panic of 1873, and Chinese residents were labeled “coolie labor”
    * Workingmen's Party (formed 1876) argued that the presence of Chinese laborers depressed wages, pushing for legislation excluding Chinese immigrants from the US
    * 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act - first discriminatory federal laws that targeted a particular national group - banned chinese immigration
      * It was renewed and made permanent in 1902; repealed in 1943

  * Mining Boomtowns in the West
    * Towns grew rapidly, often populated by prospectors
    * Boomtown - Virginia City in NV
    * Many boomtowns were extremely ethnically diverse, and as mining operations became more elaborate and industrial, the towns more closely resembled the industrial cities of the East

  * Ranching and the Era of the Cowboy in the West
    * From the mid 1860s-80s, cowboys drove large herds of cattle across the open plains
    * However, several factors ended the era of open-range grazing by the mid 1880s
    * Large ranchers began to enclose grazing areas with newly-invented barbed wire, and severe blizzards in the late 1880s decimated the cattle population of the Great Plains - after which cowboys were replaced by wage-earning hired hands, working under managers

  * Farming on the Great Plains
    * The first generation of pioneers drawn to the Great Plains were nicknamed “sodbusters” because they had to cut through the thick layer of sod to get to the topsoil necessary for farming
      * Sod was also used to build their houses
    * Although some farmers obtained land directly from the government through the Homestead Act, but most purchased land from railroads, or speculators who obtained land from unsuccessful homesteaders
    * As the century progressed, this dream of land ownership proved to be beyond the means of many people
    * The family farms of the prairie gave way to large-scale agribusinesses
    * By the late 1800s, as farmers went into debt from the boom of large-scale farming, increasing numbers of residents of the West were migrant farmers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and hired employees as land was consolidated into fewer and fewer hands

Violence on the Frontier

  * Destruction of the Buffalo
    * Railroad workers and passengers went on a killing spree, shooting buffalo for food and (mostly) sport
    * Industrial uses for their hides put pressure on their numbers
    * In a matter of decades, the buffalo herds on the Plains were virtually exterminated, which weakened the Plains people, who depended on the buffalo

  * Red Cloud’s War and the Second Treaty of Fort Laramie
    * The Homestead Act and development of railroad lines brought a wave of settlers into the Great Plains region
    * Between 1866 and 1868, fighting occurred in the WY and MO territories between US troops and the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Northern Arapaho
    * Known as Red Cloud’s War, it included a major defeat for US forces in a battle (Fetterman’s Fight), it ended with the Second Treaty of Fort Laramie, in which the US allowed the Lakota to maintain much of the disputed territory and close the Bozeman Trail

  * The Indian Peace Commission (1867)
    * Congress tried to negotiate an end of warring on the Great Plains by establishing the Indian Peace Commission
    * The commission met in St.Louis, Missouri with a number of Plains Indian
    * Although several treaties were negotiated, Congress did not consistently fund or enforce agreements made by the commission
    * Congress wanted to confine Indian groups to reservations and pursue a policy of assimilation, but the commission ultimately failed as fighting on the Plains continued

  * The Battle of Little Big Horn and Custer’s Last Stand (1876)
    * Discovery of gold in the Black HIlls of the Dakota Territory in 1874 brought more settlers and brought tensions to a peak
    * Great Sioux War (1876) - Sioux warriors, along with Cheyenne allies, achieved a major victory over American forces at the Battle of Little Big Horn
    * The episode, also known as Custer’s Last Stand, resulted in the death of George Custer + 225 men
    * After, US forces led by General Sheridan defeated Indian forces → Lakota Sioux were confined to a reservation in the Dakota Territory
    * The defeat of the largest and most warlike Plains Indian tribes was a major turning point in the long campaign by the government of controlling the Plains Indians

Government Policies and the Fate of American Indians

  * President Grant and the “Peace Policy”
    * In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant announced that the government would pursue a peace policy in regard to Indians with assimilation as its goal
    * The goal was that eventually, individual Indians would become “wards of the state” and be civilized by emissaries, then become citizens with individual ownership of plots of land, rather than reservations owned by groups
    * It did not initially gain many adherents

  * Helen Hunt Jackson and the Call for Reform
    * By the 1880s, sympathizers of American Indians pushed for a change - Helen Hunt Jackson wrote A Century of Dishonor (1882) which chronicled the abuses of the USFG against the natives
    * It was seen as the duty of white middle-class women to civilize people - these women were successful in lobbying for the 1887 Dawes Severalty Act

  * Dawes Severalty Act (1887)
    * Aka General Allotment Act - abandoned the reservation system and divided tribal lands into individually owned plots (severalty refers to lands that are owned by individuals)
    * The goal was to make Indians assimilate into white culture - norms of white middle-class culture
    * This reform was as damaging to Indians as was the earlier reservation policy

  * Indian Boarding Schools
    * Late 1870s - Bureau of Indian Affairs established a series of Indian boarding schools that were designed to assimilate Indian children by stripping them of their culture
    * Ex. Carlisle Institute in PA (est. 1879) - students were forced to cut their hair, rid themselves of traditional clothing, practice christianity, trained in menial tasks
    * “Kill the Indian in him, save the man”

American Indian Resistance

  * The Ghost Dance Movement
    * Some tribes, among the great losses they suffered, adopted a spiritual practice known as the Ghost Dance
    * Developed by a prophet named Wovoka, he emphasized cooperation among tribes and clean living and honesty

  * Wounded Knee and the End of Autonomous American Indian Groups
    * The last battle of the Indian Wars was at Wounded Knee Creek in SD (1890) - US troops attempted to peacefully disarm a group of Lakota Indians but soon opened fire on the Lakota men, women, and children (200+ people died)

===== The “New South” =====

The Limited Success of Calls for a “New South”

  * The Persistence of Tradition in the “New South”
    * Henry Grady argued for a mixed economy in the South that would include industrialization
    * He wanted to move away from single-crop plantation agriculture
    * However, this promised remained hollow - blacks continued to toil in sharecropping systems (paying with a share of their yearly crop) or tenant farming (owned his own tools and rented the land at a fixed rate)

Segregation in the “New South”

  * The Proliferation of the “Jim Crow” System
    * Jim Crow laws segregated public facilities such as railroad cars, restrooms, and schools
    * Relegated blacks to second-class status in the South
    * SCOTUS ruled that the 14th Amendment did not protect blacks from Jim Crow laws

  * Plessy v. Ferguson and the “Separate but Equal” Doctrine
    * Opponents argued that the 14th Amendment stated no person shall be denied equal protection of the laws, however, the Court stated that segregation was acceptable as long as the facilities for both races were of equal quality

  * Challenging Jim Crow in the Gilded Age
    * Ida B. Wells was a black woman who sued the Memphis and Charleston Railroad for denying her a seat in the ladies’ car
    * She won the case initially, but the railroad ultimately won on appeal
    * After 3 friends of hers were lynched, she wrote against the practice of lynching, and that it was a tactice to suppress black political activism and re-assert white supremacy
    * Booker T. Washington encouraged blacks to gain training in vocational skills and argued that confrontation with whites would end badly for blacks, instead counseling cooperation with supportive whites

===== Technological Innovation =====

The Raw Materials of Industrialization

  * Steel and the Bessemer Process
    * Steel production was the key to the industrialization of the US
    * Although iron production grew and was used extensively in the railroads, steel - an alloy of iron - was found to be more durable, versatile, and useful than iron
    * Before the middle of the 1800s, it was too expensive to be commercially useful
    * The development of the Bessemer process greatly reduced the cost of steel and made it available to a wide variety of industrial operations, and by the 1860s, a more efficient production method, called the open-hearth process, replaced the Besssemer process

  * Coal and Oil
    * Most practical fuel went from hard coal (anthracite) and softer coal (bituminous) → oil (George Bissel demonstrated that oil could be refined and used for a variety of processes)
    * Its most industrial use was lubricating machinery
    * Later in the century, the demand for oil increased as it came to be refined into gasoline

===== The Rise of Industrial Capitalism =====

The Rise of the Corporation and Mass Production

  * The Evolution of the Corporation and the Managerial Revolution
    * Before the Civil War, many states made it easy for an entity to incorporate
      * Incorporation: the formation of individuals into an organized entity with legally defined privileges and responsibilities
    * The Pennsylvania Railroad incorporated in 1846 and many entities followed suit after the Civil War
    * Large corporations developed management systems that separated top executives from managers
    * This led to the managerial revolution, which included modern cost-accounting procedures and the division of responsibilities
    * A new class of middle managers evolved in the post-Civil War period, supervising purchasing, accounting, marketing, sales, etc.
    * This also created the need for secretaries and other office workers, opening up new opportunities for women in the workforce

  * Advances in Marketing and Distribution
    * During the late 1800s, industrial capitalism devised methods to distribute the large quantities of good produced by growing factories
    * Patterns of consumption began to change: many products, mostly clothing, went from home → commercial production
      * Home grown produce → canned foods

  * Chain Outlets and Department Stores
    * Retail outlets began to replace small-scale local stores
    * Chains such as Atlantic and Pacific (A&P) Tea Company (groceries) and F.W. Woolworth (manufactured dry goods) opened outlets in cities and towns throughout the US
    * Department stores such as Wanamaker’s in Philadelphia and Macy’s in NYC catered towards middle-class residents
    * Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery ward printed catalogs and created a system of installment payment plans
    * One no longer had to be near a metropolitan center or the actual stores because of mail-order catalogs

  * The Labor Force in the Industrial Era
    * Before the Civil War, immigrants were primarily from northern and western Europe, but by the 1870s, new sources of immigration included southern and eastern Europe, Mexico, and China
    * Employers hired recruiters to pay for the passage of European immigrants → this was made illegal in 1885

Economic Consolidation

  * The Rise of the Major Industries
    * The 3 major industries were railroads, steel, and oil
    * The corporate model spread to many industrial processes such as bicycles, clothing, shoes, and paper

  * The “Robber Barons”
    * Term given to the men who controlled the major industries in the US
    * Means to call attention to their cutthroat business activities and attempts to control governments

  * Andrew Carnegie and Vertical Integration
    * Andrew Carnegie came to dominate the steel industry by investing in all aspects of steel production
    * Carnegie Steel Company controlled the mills where steel was made, the coal mines that supplied the coal, and iron ore mines that supplied the base of the steel
    * He also controlled the transportation lines - ships that transported iron and railroads that transported the coal to the factory
    * Vertical integration - all key aspects of the business are performed by the company itself

  * Rockefeller and Horizontal Integration (or Consolidation)
    * Horizontal integration - merging of companies that create the same or similar products
    * This can lead to a monopoly → a common way that corporations gained monopoly control of an industry was by establishing trusts
    * A trust consisted of trustees from several companies in the same industry acting together rather than against each other
    * Rockefeller organized the most well known trust in the oil-processing industry: Standard Oil

  * Other “Robber Barons”
    * Among Carnegie and Rockefeller were railroad magnate Collis P. Huntington, coal and iron merchant Mark Hanna, meat processing giant Philip Armour, and mining and railroad Stephen Elkins
    * J.P. Morgan, a financier, gained leverage through control of various industries, including several railroad companies, into dominance of the entire US economy

Corporations Look Abroad

  * The Growth of Multinational Corporations
    * Foreign trade was rapidly expanding in the Gilded Age: $400 million in the 1870s → $1.4 billion in 1900
    * Several companies like Standard Oil, Eastman Kodak, and American Tobacco established branches in other countries
    * The Panic of 1893 further encouraged business men to seek new markets abroad
    * Moreover, because the American frontier was closed - nothing more West to explore - the next logical step for many Americans was to expand into foreign territory

===== Labor in the Gilded Age =====

Poverty and Wealth in Industrializing America

  * The Wealthy Class
    * The Gilded Age saw the growth of a wealthy class that far surpassed the wealth inequality of the past → building mansions in exclusive urban neighborhoods and summer cottages
    * Thorstein Veblen in The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), coined the phrase “conspicuous consumption” to describe the lavish spending habits of the wealthy

  * The Working Class
    * Wage for workers rose slightly, but were still way below minimum levels today
    * Wages would be cut in the Panics of 1873 and 1893
    * However, families who moved to big industrial cities had amounts of spending money that were unimaginable in the small towns they came from
    * And although they did not receive much wages, the prices of goods were falling due to industrialization

An Expanding Workforce

  * Women and Children in the Labor Force
    * Skilled craftsmanship → unskilled tasks in a mass-production system = children and women enter the paid workforce in large numbers as wages for working-class men remained low
    * The influx of women and children into the workforce depressed overall wages
    * From 1870s-WWI, child labor grew each decade
    * By 1900, children made up 18% and women made up 17% of the workforce

Conflict at the Work Site

  * The Declining Status of Work in the Age of Industrialization
    * Fierce industrial competition worsened working conditions
    * Wages rose incrementally at times only to be erased by downturns in the economy
    * The increased reliance on child labor + immigrants further eroded wages
    * Production = loss of control over processes of production, as processes were broken down and “de-skilled” → led to a loss of sense of pride in one’s work and an increase in unsafe and unsanitary conditions
    * The loss of control of the work process was a root cause of worker grievances, responded to by labor organizations and unions through bargaining and striking

  * An Era of Pitched Battles in the Workplace
    * The labor battles of the Gilded Age were almost exclusively won by management with its near monopoly on weaponry, support of government and courts, and vast numbers of poor, working-class men willing to serve as strikebreakers
    * These battles happened during economic downturns

  * The Knights of Labor
    * A significant early union was the Knights of Labor (est. 1869)
    * Welcomed all members w/o discrimination, and led by Terence V. Powderly in the late 1880s, they wanted to improve wage and hours for workers and implement better safety rules and end child labor
    * Although gaining 800,000 members by 1886, by 1890, organizational problems led to their numbers and influence declining
    * Ethnic, linguistic, and racial barriers made united action difficult, and government repression in the wake of the Haymarket bombing in Chicago weakened the organization

  * The Great Railroad Strike of 1877
    * In 1877, a strike at McCormick Reaper Works led to the jobs of striking workers being given to scabs (replacement workers)
    * The striking workers attacked the scabs, and the police opened fire on the strikers, killing/injuring 6 men
    * The strikers called for a rally in Haymarket Square, and towards the end, a bomb exploded in the police ranks; the police responded by opening fire on the rally
    * This caused many Americans to shy away from the labor movement

  * The American Federation of Labor (AFL) (1886)
    * It only allowed skilled workers to join and did not allow blacks or women to join
    * Its only goal was getting higher wages and better conditions for its members, not working for broader social reform

  * The Homestead Strike (1892)
    * Carnegie was determined to break the union known as the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (under the AFL umbrella)
    * He announced in 1892 that he would not renew their contract, leaving the country in the summer and leaving his plant in the hands of his manager Frick
    * Frick hired Pinkerton guards to make sure the union workers could not get in, and a battle ensued between workers and “Pinks”
    * Although the workers temporarily gained control of the plant, 8,000 National Guard troops were called to retake it

  * The Pullman Strike: Strife in a Company Town (1893)
    * Occurred during the Panic of 1893 where the Pullman Company, which built railroad cars, cut wages several times
    * The town of Pullman was built by the company as a company town, providing decent housing but also control over its workers - eg. denying housing to troublemakers (pro-union workers)
    * When wages were cut in 1893 and 1894, the rent remained the same, so workers appealed to the American Railway Union
    * Three union organizers were fired, and in response, most of the 3,300 workers went on strike → leading to railroad traffic coming to a standstill
    * President Cleveland called federal troops to put the strike down, killing 25 workers
    * SCOTUS in In re Debs (1895) ruled that the government was justified in stopping the strike

===== Immigration and Migration in the Gilded Age =====

Migrations and a Diverse Workforce

  * The “New Immigration”
    * There was a new wave of immigrants in addition to the Irish and German immigrants of pre-Civil War years
    * They came from southern and eastern Europe and Asia - labeled “new immigrants”

  * The Exoduster Movement
    * Because of the rise of the KKK, Jim Crow laws, and the nature of blacks as second class citizens, approx. 40,000 blacks departed from Southern States, crossing the Mississippi to settle in Kansas
    * Black activists and white philanthropists established organizations such as Colored Relief Board and the Kansas Freedmen’s Aid Society to help them make their journey

The New Culture of Immigrant City

  * A Divided City
    * The Gilded Age is characterized by a division between the working-class districts and wealthy enclaves
    * Ex. in NYC, the wealthy moved uptown, away from the urban core where the working class districts were

  * Living Conditions for the Working Class and the Poor
    * Despite small increases in wages, the working class and poor were crammed into neighborhoods, such as the Lower East Side of New York
    * Substandard tenement buildings, lack of ventilation and light, horse dung, and a lack of basic municipal services, such as sewer lines, running water, and garbage removal

  * Working-Class Culture and Urban Life
    * City life, modest increases in wages, and slightly shorter workday provided more time for leisure activities for the masses of urban residents
    * Saloons were often part social hall, part political club, and part community hub - a place for recreation
    * Therefore, the reformist attacks on drinking were seen as an attack on saloons and working-class immigrant culture

===== Responses to Immigration in the Gilded Age =====

Debates Over Identity and Immigration

  * The Persistence of Ethnicity in the Gilded Age City
    * Immigrants felt both a need to assimilate to American culture, but also a desire to maintain ethnic solidarity
    * In NY, Chicago, foreign language papers emerged such as Jewish Daily Forward and Il Progresso Italo-Americano
    * There formed Little Italy and Jewish neighborhoods - these ethnic enclaves provided grocery stores so that immigrants could purchase foods reminiscent of their countries of origin
    * Millions of immigrants worked for part of the year in the US and then spent the rest in their home country - called “birds of passage”

  * Immigration and Nativism
    * The new immigrants heightened fears among conservative, Protestant public figures such as Henry Cabot Lodge and Madison grant, who feared that whites were committing race suicide by allowing inferior races to enter America in large numbers

Justifying the Inequities of the Gilded Age

  * The Waning of the Free Labor Ideal
    * Originally it put forth the idea that working for another person was a temporary condition, and that every employee would accumulate enough money to start his own farm or shop
    * However, with the army of unskilled workers flooding into the massive firms of the late 19th century
    * The notion of free labor was challenged, and some embraced the new corporate order

  * Social Darwinism
    * Popularized by William Graham Sumner who argued against government intervention, and argued that the inequalities of wealth of the late 1800s were part of the “survival of the fittest”

  * Horatio Alger and the Myth of the Self-made Man
    * Alger wrote a series of cheap novels that depicted a poor boy who achieved success

===== Development of the Middle Class =====

The Growth of the Urban Middle Class and the Expansion of Consumer Culture

  * Rise of the Middle Class
    * A class of white-collar employees became essential to the functioning of industrial capitalism
    * Their wages rose faster, and workday was shorter than the working-class (blue-collar)
    * Women filled many of the lower-level white collar jobs, and as the typewriter came into use, literate women learned the skill and were hired to perform office duties
    * Women were also hired as school teachers

  * The Commercialization of Leisure
    * The growth of the middle class went hand in hand with the commercialization of leisure time activities
    * Ex. amusement park - Coney Island, “Buffalo Bill” Cody’s Wild West show, and P.T. Barnum’s circus

  * Newspapers
    * Joseph Pultizer’s New York World and William Randolph Hearst’s New York Journal gained readership through exaggerated, sensationalistic coverage of events
    * This “yellow journalism” played a role in pushing public opinion toward support for the 1898 Spanish-American War

  * The Health of the City and Parks Movement
    * As germ theory developed, public parks were part of a strategy to provide an alternative to dirty streets and alleyways for healthful recreation

  * Frederick Law Olmsted and New York’s Central Park
    * The design competition was won by Olmsted and Calvert Vaux
    * On one hand, Olmsted sought to create a democratic meeting place where the city’s different classes could congregate and enjoy the benefits of nature, however, working class advocates wondered why the park was built so far from the working-class districts of the city

  * Recreation and Spectator Sports
    * Baseball: the national pastime developed in 1845
    * Tennis: Lawn tennis was developed in Great Britain (1873) as mainly a women’s sport, but gained popularity with both men and women in the Gilded Age

===== Reform in the Gilded Age =====

Challenges to the Dominant Corporate Ethic

  * Henry George and the “Single Tax” on Land
    * In his book Progress and Poverty (1879), he criticized the vast resources, especially land, controlled by the wealthy elite. He argued for a “single tax” on land values, which he believed would create a more equitable society

  * Socialism and Anarchism
    * Many began to question the basic assumptions of capitalism and embraced alternative ideologies
    * After the failure of the Pullman Strike, Eugene V. Debs became one of the founders of the Socialist Party of America in 1901

  * Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward, 2000-1887
    * This novel imagined a man who falls asleep in 1887 and awakens in 2000 to find a socialist utopia in which the inequities and poverty of the Gilded Age have been eradicated

  * Coxey’s Army
    * A group of workers, many recently laid off by railroad companies (1894), marched from Ohio to DC to demand that the government take action to address the economic crisis

Debates Around Pursuing an Imperialist Policy

  * Industry and Empire
    * Many Americans resisted the idea of the US embarking on overseas possessions, however, the desire for new markets led the country to look abroad

===== Politics in the Gilded Age =====

Farmers and the Populist Party

  * The Populist Party was formed by activists to challenge the growth of corporate power over the agricultural sector; they sought a radical redistribution of power in the US and pushed for stronger government intervention in the economy

  * Organizing the Populist Party
    * Born in 1893, it was able to harness the discontent after the Panic of 1893 and gave voice to a radical program for change that included increased democracy, a graduated income tax, regulation of the railroads, and currency reform
    * They insisted that the amount of currency in circulation was insufficient, and called for “free and unlimited coinage” of silver
    * Their party did remarkably well in the presidential election later that year, but their popularity was short lived

  * The Election of 1896 and the “Cross of Gold” Speech
    * The election of 1896 resulted in the demise of the populist party and helped establish the identity of the major political parties in the 20th century
    * William Jennnings Bryan called for free and unlimited coinage of silver, and in his Cross of Gold speech, he promised not to let the American people be crucified upon a cross of gold, and endorsed by the populist party
    * On the other hand McKinley appealed to banking and business interests by keeping the country on the gold standard, and won the election
    * The Republican Party continued to be more aligned with pro-business interests and the Democratic Party continued to present itself as the champion of the “little guy”

Politics, Big Business, and Corruption in the Gilded Age

  * The Evolution of the Two-Party System
    * Neither party was able to dominate politics during the last decades of the 19th century, and both seem to be increasingly removed from the concerns of ordinary Americans
    * They seemed to be more responsive to the priorities of the newly formed trusts and industrial giants than to the needs of farmers or workers, which is why the Populist Party formed

  * Ideology Takes a Back Seat
    * Issues like child labor, the consolidation of industries, workplace safety, and abuses by railroad companies were either avoided or dealt with superficially
    * Neither party did much to protect rights of blacks or indians, or rights of women
    * Both were divided on the tariff - Democrats wanted lower tariff rates and Republicans wanted higher tariff rates
    * Both parties seemed to be aligned with the priorities of big business - taking bribes and favors

  * Corruption and the Grant Administration
    * Grant’s Administration was tainted by corruption, and many government spots were given to friends
    * He surrounded himself with incompetent staff, and was indecisive on the Reconstruction

  * Corruption and Civil-Service Reform
    * Civil service is the workforce of government employees - attempted were made to remove nepotism from government hiring - hiring the most qualified people instead

  * Mugwumps, Stalwarts, and Half-Breeds
    * Reform-minded Republicans, nicknamed “Mugwumps”, wanted to move away from the corruption of the Grant years and create a merit-based civil service
    * Their opposition were the Stalwarts, and those who were loyal republicans but wanted some degree of reform, were known as the Half-Breeds

  * The Pendleton Act
    * The Republicans nominated Garfield for president in 1880, but was assassinated 4 months after inauguration, shot by Guiteau who claimed it was because he was denied a government job
    * Congress passed the Pendleton Act in 1883 to set up a merit-based federal civil service, a professional career service that allots government jobs on the basis of a competitive exam

  * The Politics of Tariff Rates
    * Industrialists tended to encourage higher tariffs to keep out foreign goods, and they were supported by the Republicans
    * Democrats tended to support a lower tariff rate - their cotton and wheat sales benefited from increased international trade
    * President Chester Arthur broke with Republican orthodoxy and lowered tariff rates
    * Many Democrats, including Cleveland began to push for lower tariff rates - arguing that it would put more money into circulation and stimulate economic activity
    * Many tariff reformers became increasingly critical of the power of trusts and large corporations in dominating the economy at the expense of consumers and small producers
    * In 1888, Benjamin Harrison signed into law the highest tariff in the nation’s history

  * The Currency Issue
    * The vibrant economic growth that characterized much of the last decades came to a screeching halt in 1983 because of the Panic of 1893
    * Many historians cite the inadequate amount of currency in circulation as one of the underlying weaknesses in the economy - the money supply did not have the possibility to grow as the economy expanded

Politics, Power, and Reform in Urban America

  * Urban Politics and the Rise of Machine Politics
    * Politics came to be dominated by political machines - smooth running organizations whose purpose was to achieve and maintain political power, usually regardless of political ideology
    * NYC was dominated by the Democratic Party machine, run by party “bosses” and headquartered at Tammany Hall - most notable was Tammany Chief William Marcy Tweed
    * Boss Tweed earned a reputation for corruption, however, under the Democratic Party, the city initiated massive municipal projects that provided jobs to thousands of immigrants

  * The Campaign Against Prostitution
    * Religious-based activists saw the practice as sinful, whereas campaigners for gender equality saw a double standard in society’s acceptance of male extramarital sexual activities, and public health advocates saw this as spreading venereal disease, and anti-poverty activists saw this as reinforcing a cycle of poverty of working class women
    * These forced pressured local authorities to close red-light districts, and successfully lobbied for the Mann Act (1910) which cracked down on the transport of women across states to engage in prostitution

  * The Temperance Campaign
    * This was especially popular among women who were troubled by the fact that their husbands often drank away their paychecks
    * Another reason for the movement’s popularity was that it complemented the anti-immigrant movement (against saloons were immigrants would drink)

===== Subject to Debate =====

  * The Appropriateness of the Label: Robber Baron
    * Most big companies were incorporated and run by boards of directors, not one big money man, and moreover, the rising tide of wealth generated helped lift all boats through higher wages and better conditions

  * The Populist Movement - Reasonable or Irrational?
    * One one hand, some historians see the movement as a reasonable response to the dire situation farmers were in
    * However, others paint it as an irrational, emotional rebellion against the modern world, citing racism and anti-immigrant sentiment in the movement

  * Corrupt Political Bosses and Immigrant Communities
    * Although there is truth to the narrative that bosses undermined democracy until reformers rose up to clean the political process, political machines provided the only safety net and jobs program for recently arrived immigrants
    * In some ways, the attacks on the political machines were attacks on the structure of the immigrant community

  * The American Anti-Imperialist League
    * Included conservative Democrats (Bourbon Democrats) as well as some progressives (Mark Twain)
    * Condemned imperialism in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War

  * A Departure from American Traditions
    * Instead of earlier acquisitions of land such as the Louisiana purchase that were designed to expand US territory, new imperialism would essentially be US rule over a foreign population
    * Critics saw this as an immoral departure from the democratic traditions of a nation that was born in a war against a major power

  * Anti-imperialist Sentiment and White Supremacy
    * Not all critics of imperialism were progressive - some critics feared that by acquiring the Philippines, the US would experience an influx of Filipinos
    * Worried about “polluting” the American population

===== The Spanish-American War and Its Aftermath =====

The Spanish-American War

    * By 1898, ¼ of the population had died from starvation and disease
    * Some American businessmen wanted to intervene because of the sugar harvest, and other citizens wanted to intervene because it was a struggle for independence, much like the US had experienced

  * “Yellow Journalism” and the Call to War
    * Events in Cuba were brought to attention through newspapers
    * Increased literacy set the groundwork for America’s first mass media, and to attract customers, newspapers began printing bold, sensational headlines, sometimes warping the truth
    * News organizations used these techniques to build support for war with Spain

  * Sinking of the Maine
    * The event that led directly to the Spanish-American war was the destruction of American battleship, the USS Maine, which blew up in Havana
    * Although there was a lack of evidence that Spain caused this to happen, as a result of heightened tensions because of yellow journalism, many Americans pointed to Spain as the culprit

  * US Victory in the Spanish-American War
    * The US declared war in April 1898, and Spain agreed to an armistice 4 months later
    * American forces landed in Cuba on June 22, 1898, and Spanish forced surrendered on July 17

    * Anti-imperialists insisted that the Constitution did not permit the American government to make laws for people who were not represented

  * Cuba and the Platt Amendment
    * Cuba would become independent in name only - the US wanted to ensure that American economic interests would not be challenged by a future Cuban administration
    * The Platt Amendment allowed the US to militarily intervene in Cuban affairs if it deemed necessary, limited the Cuban government’s ability to conduct foreign policy, and allowed the US to lease a naval base at Guantanamo Bay

The United States as an Imperialism Power

  * The Insular Cases
    * As the US gained territories, the question of whether constitutional rights should be applied to people in new American territories led to heated debates
    * Expansionists argued that residents of colonies should not expect citizenship or basic constitutional rights
    * Anti-imperialists saw this as hypocrisy, that denying constitutional rights to people living under an American flag, would “put them into the rank of land-grabbing nations of Europe”
    * SCOTUS settled this in a series of cases known as the “Insular Cases”, and ruled that the imperial power need not grant its subjects constitutional rights, on the basis that the subjects were of an inferior race, and that the colonial power had the responsibility to uplift these people before granting them autonomy

  * War in the Philippines
    * Many Filipinos were disappointed to learn that the US decided to hold on to the Philippines because they saw the US as a liberating force
    * Following the Treaty of Paris, the three year long Philippine-American War ensued, far more deadly than the Spanish-American War
    * Filipino forces were led by Emilio Aguinaldo and continued to resist for the next decade - but the US would hold onto the Philippines until WWII

  * China and the Open Door Policy
    * Major European powers had begun carving China out into spheres of influence
    * John Hay, US secretary of state, asserted an open door policy for China
    * The US pretended to be concerned for the territorial integrity of China, but was more interested in gaining a foothold in trade with China

  * The Boxer Rebellion

    * They led a rebellion that resulted in the death of more than 30,000 Chinese converts as well as 250 foreign nuns

  * Theodore Roosevelt and the “Big Stick”
    * Roosevelt asserted that the US should “speak softly, but carry a big stick”, referring to military force
    * He claimed that the US had the right to militarily intervene in the nations of Latin America - the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine
    * In 1902, he warned Germany to stay out of Venezuela after they failed to repay a loan to Germany and Germany threatened military intervention

  * Panama and the Panama Canal
    * With the acquisition of overseas Pacific territories, policymakers wanted a shortcut to Asia
    * Before 1903, Panama was a region of Colombia, and when Colombia refused the US offer of $10 million to build a canal, the US instigated a rebellion in Panama against Colombia
    * Panama became an independent country and immediately agreed to the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty (1903) with the US to build the canal

    * Roosevelt worked out a Gentleman’s Agreement in which Japan agreed to limit immigration to the US and he agreed to pressure California to end discriminatory practice

  * President Taft and “Dollar Diplomacy”
    * Taft continued an aggressive foreign policy, but put more emphasis on expanding and securing American commercial interests - came to be known as dollar diplomacy

    * Failed to stem the Mexican Revolution in 1911

  * President Wilson’s Foreign Policy

    * Progressives gravitated towards this idea

  * Reform Darwinism
    * Progressive activists rejected Social Darwinism, and instead thought the evolution of human society required active intervention and cooperation, rather than a laissez-faire approach

Divisions Within the Progressive Movement

  * The Progressive Movement, Race, and Segregation
    * The Southern states have Jim Crow laws and the Ku Klux Klan - eugenics tried to justify segregation with races having inferior capabilities
    * Many activists and progressivists ignored the conditions of Afircan Americans, and some even endorsed segregation
    * Wilson ordered the segregation of government offices, and praised racist films

  * Fighting Segregation in the Progressive Era
    * The principal voices for social justice for black people came from bnlack activists who attempted to put the issue of racism on the national agenda, ex. W. E. B. Du Bois

  * Different Directions Among African-American Leaders
    * Du Bois’s call for full political equality and civil rights was in contrast to the more conciliatory approach of Booker T. Washington
    * Marcus Garvey was important in the black-nationalist movement because of his advocacy of black people returning to their ancestral homelands in Africa, and although not many people made this journey, this instilled pride in African Americans

  * Democracy Versus Expertise in Progressive Governance
    * When it came to challenging corrupt political machines, progressives either tried to empower professional manager and planners, while others tried to empower the citizenry through democratic reforms

  * Expertise, Efficiency, and Mastery
    * Some argued that governance based on rational scientific ideas could overcome forces contributing to societal drift

  * Efficiency and Municipal Government in the Wake of the Galveston Flood
    * When a flood killed 8,000 people in Galveston, given the inept government response, local leaders created commissions to spearhead the cleanup and rebuilding of the city

    * Because of the long working hours and child labor, the movement to reform the workplace suffered a set-back in 1905 Lochner v. New York, SCOTUS ruled that NY law restricting hours for bakers was unconstitutional
    * However, in Muller v. Oregon (1908), the decision upheld an Oregon law limiting the number of hours women could work
    * Brandeis wrote a brief, citing a lot of scientific, psychological, and sociological studies to bolster his case of limiting women’s hours of work
    * This kind of case citing studies came to be known as a “Brandeis brief”

  * Challenging Child Labor
    * Photographs of children in workplace settings brought child labor to public attention
    * Because labor laws were under state law, Congress could only pass legislation prohibiting the sale of items produced in factories that employed children under 14 years of age

  * Progressivism in the White House
    * In the early 20th century, progressivism entered the discourse of the national political parties

    * The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed to limit monopolies; he used the act to pursue bad trusts - ones that interfered with commerce
    * Northern Securities Company controlled all railroad traffic in the Northwest, from Chicago to Washington, and eliminated competition in this region
    * In Northern Securities Co. v. United States (1904), SCOTUS broke the company up under the Sherman Antitrust Act
    * Became “trust buster” for challenging monopolies

  * The Administration of William Howard Taft
    * Taft won the 1908 election
    * He disappointed Progressives by agreeing to higher tariff rates in the Payne-Aldrich Tariff (1909), despite progressives trying to reduce consumer prices
    * However, he did pursue antitrust suits, initiating 90 antitrust causes, including a major case against US Steel

  * Taft, Roosevelt, and the Election
    * Roosevelt came to regret supporting Taft, and so a rift appeared in the Republican Party between Roosevelt and Taft
    * This division caused the Democratic Party’s Woodrow Wilson to win

  * Progressivism and Woodrow Wilson
    * He was only the second Democrat to serve since Andrew Johnson, possibly because the Republicans “waved the bloody shirt”, invoking the memory of the Democrats’ role in secession and the Civil War
    * He was known as a progressive reformer

  * Wilson and the Federal Reserve Act
    * Because of his suspicion of the banking industry, being in service of the stock market more than the American public
    * He pushed for the Federal Reserve Act, which created the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913, part private and part publicly controlled bank
    * Its policies can expand or contract the currency supply to combat a sluggish or inflated economy
    * In addition, it can lower or raise its interest rates on loans, causing other banks to follow
    * Ex. lower interest rates = more economic activity, higher interest rates = cool economic activity/prevent inflation

  * Regulation of Business
    * Wilson was a supporter of small business and strengthened the antitrust powers of the USFG with the Clayton Antitrust Act (1914), exempting labor unions from being targeted by antitrust actions
    * Created the Federal Trade Commission (1914) to regulate unfair business practices

  * The Prohibition Movement and the Eighteenth Amendment
    * Saloons were seen as parasites on working-class communities, profiting off alcohol abuse
    * The 18th Amendment banned the production, sale, and transportation of alcohol as of 1920

Addressing Environmental Issues in the Progressive Era

  * Concern for Disappearing Wilderness
    * Zoologist/adventurer George Bird Grinnell and Roosevelt organized the Boone and Crockett Club to lobby for environmental protection

  * Roosevelt and Conservation
    * Appointed Gifford Piunchot to head the US Forest Service and the government’s conservation efforts

  * Expansion of the National Park System
    * It was began in 1872 with Yellowstone, and Yosemite became a national park in 1890
    * Roosevelt created 5 additional parks and 150 national forests, ultimately putting over 200 million acres under public protection

  * Conservation and Preservationism
    * Conservation: nation’s natural resources should be used in a responsible way so they continue to exist for future generations
    * Preservation: wants nature to be hands-off to society
    * Conservation tapped more into progressive thinking - efficiency, expertise, scientific management, and government intervention

  * The Controversy over Hetch Hetchy Valley
    * The valley was targeted by San Fran. officials as a possible water source/potential reservoir
    * The Wilson administration gave in after an earthquake and fire destroyed much of San Fran. in 1906

===== World War I: Military and Diplomacy =====

The United States Enters World War I

  * The Context of WWI
    * Nationalism, imperialism, militarism, the alliance system
    * This sense of nationalism was fueled by a competition to imperialize the remaining independent areas of Asia and Africa

  * The Onset of War
    * Assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand → Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia
    * The alliance system brought Germany and Italy into the conflict on the side of Austria-Hungary while Russia, France, and Great Britain (Triple Entente) were on the opposing side
    * The Allied Powers fought against the Central Powers (Italy switched sides in 1915) for 4 years and resulted in the deaths of 8.5 million soldiers

  * US Neutrality
    * The US initially assumed it could stay neutral during WWI
    * Adopted a policy of isolationism when it came to matters on the European continent
    * Neutrality allowed the US to trade with both sides of the conflict

  * Immigration Patterns and Public Opinion Around WWI
    * German and Irish immigrants tended to favor the Central Powers while many Americans favored the Allied Powers because of their ties to Great Britain

  * From Neutrality to Intervention
    * Wilson emphasized “freedom of the seas”, indicating the US would sell weapons to anyone
    * However, as Britain blockaded Germany, a majority of weapons were traded to Britain
    * Germany responded by threatening attack on US ships by U-boats (submarines)
    * The sinking of the British liner, Lusitania, influenced many Americans, and so Germany pledged to make no attacks on passenger ships without prior warning in both the Arabic Pledge and the Sussex Pledge (extending the protection to merchant ships)
    * The US took advantage of this and traded extensively with Great Britain

  * Progressives and the War
    * At the beginning, many progressives were hesitant because they thought participation in a major war would pull the nation from domestic reform
    * However, many saw great possibilities in American participation: expansion of the USFG, sense of unity and nationalism, and renewed focus on issues of social Justice

  * President Wilson and the War
    * Wilson became increasingly convinced that the US needed to participate to make the world “safe for democracy”, especially as the Allied Powers seemed to be more democratic (after Russia dropped out)
    * The American public was divided, and the government went to great lengths to alter public opinion

  * The Zimmerman Note and Unrestricted German Submarine Warfare
    * The intercepted telegram from German foreign secretary Zimmerman indicated that Germany would help Mexico regain territory it had lost to the US if Mexico joined the war
    * Germany also announced in 1917 that it would rescind the Sussex Pledge and resume unrestricted submarine warfare against Britain and its allies
    * In 1917, the US declared war on Germany

  * Shaping Public Opinion
    * Wilson established the Committee on Public Information in 1917 to organize pro-war propaganda
    * The CPI sent Four-Minute Men around the country to give brief speeches in favor of the war
    * Posters depicted ruthless German soldiers, depicted as Huns
    * Uncle Sam poster :)

  * Funding the War
    * Many posters encouraged Americans to purchase bonds to fund the war’s cost
    * “If you can’t enlist - invest”
    * The USFG ended up raising ⅔ the war’s costs from war bonds

  * Federal Agencies and War Production
    * War Industries Board created to direct industrial production, ensure uninterrupted production of arms, uniforms, etc.
    * The FDA ensured sufficient food production to feed the troops and civilians
    * National War Labor Policies Board dealt with labor disputes
    * These government agencies were exactly what progressive reformers had hoped to create on a permanent basis

The Role of the US in WWI

  * American Participation in WWI
    * 2 million soldiers of the American Expeditionary Force provided the Allies with much needed reinforcement
    * Trench warfare made it difficult for either side to gain much ground
    * The Allies’ advances towards the German border, aided by American troops, led Germany to seek a ceasefire

The US and the Postwar World

  * Wilson’s 14 Points
    * This was a document where WIlson envisioned a world order based on freedom of the seas, removal of barriers to trade, self determination for EUropeans, and an international organization to resolve conflicts
    * Only the League of Nations resulted from this

  * United States Rejection of the Treaty of Versailles
    * US did not join the League of Nations, as they would have had to approve the Treaty of Versailles, which was rejected by the Senate in 1919

===== World War I: Home Front =====

WWI and the Conservative Rejection of Progressive Reform

  * Civil Liberties During Wartime
    * Despite hopes of progressives, there were also curtailments of civil liberties during the wartime
    * The Espionage and Sedition Acts were passed during WWI to put limits on public expressions of antiwar sentiment, making it a crime to interfere with the draft, war bonds, or say anything disloyal about the war effort
    * The Espionage Act was upheld by SCOTUS in Schenck v. United States, ruling that freedom of speech is not absolute and can be limited in wartime

  * The Crusade against Organized Labor and Dissent
    * When WWI ended, the government disbanded the agencies it created to regulate the economy during the war
    * Workers no longer had the protections of the National War Labor Policies Board, and inflation was no longer kept in check
    * Biggest strike - Seattle General Strike where the Industrial Workers of the World and the American Federation of Labor worked together to virtually close down Seattle
    * Management used techniques to maintain the upper hand - painting striking workers as Bolsheviks, pushing for open shops - workplaces in which the union could not require workers to join the union, and government intervention: ex. SCOTUS ruling that picketing was not protected by the First Amendment

  * The “Red Scare”
    * Campaign against Communists, anarchists, and other radicals, also targeting labor leaders, attempting to portray the labor movement as a front for organizing
    * Caused by the successful Bolshevik Revolution in Russia that brought the Communist Party to power and the establishment of the USSR, and the Comintern, an international organization of communists trying to duplicate that success in other countries
    * The communist movement in the US was extremely small, however, the government took action: Attorney General Palmer began carrying out unwarranted raids (“Palmer Raids”) of suspected radicals’ homes
    * Deported more than 500 noncitizens, radical newspapers shut down, libraries were purged of radical books, accused elected officials were removed from office
    * Schenck v. United States gave cover to restrictions on civil liberties
    * Americans began to question Palmer’s tactics, but suspicion of “reds” persisted throughout the 1920s

  * The Trial of Sacco and Vanzetti
    * Sacco and Vanzetti (immigrants and anarchists), accused of robbery and murder, despite the sketchy evidence, were found guilt and executed
    * This showed the intolerance that many Americans had toward immigrants and radicals - many Americans also protested the verdict

World War I and the Rise of Nativism

  * Anti-Immigrant Sentiment
    * Nativism - opposition to immigration - rose sharply during WWI
    * Government propaganda and the Committee for Public Information (which encouraged people to report neighbors who were undermining the war effort) contributed to hatred towards German Americans
    * Libraries banned German books and schools prohibited the teaching of German, and Congress passed the Immigration Restriction Act which established a reading test requirement for admission to the US and barred immigrant laborers from several countries that were designated as the “Asiatic Barred Zone”

War, Opportunity, and Migration

  * The Great Migration
    * The needs of industry for labor during WWI led to the Great Migration of African Americans out of the South, which lasted until the Great Depression
    * Reasons for rural South → urban North
      * Jim Crow Laws, discrimination
      * Segregation
      * Exclusion from political system - literacy tests and poll taxes
    * The main factor that drew them to the North was jobs - factory agents from the North frequently made recruiting trips to the South, offering immediate employment and free passage to the North

  * Racial Violence - Chicago, Washington, Tulsa, and Beyond
    * A riot in Chicago left 38 people dead and 500 injured
    * 1921 in Tulsa, Oklahoma - a young black man who tripped over a white woman was accused of rape - a group of African-American veterans tried to prevent crowds from lynching the man
    * A riot ensued, destroying Greenwood District (the wealthiest African-American community), with over 10,000 left homeless and 300 African Americans killed

===== 1920s: Innovation in Communications and Technology =====

Technological Advances, Corporate Growth, and the Consumer Economy

  * Toward Greater Consolidation
    * The consumption of consumer goods stimulated the American economy
    * New products, such as automobiles and radios captured the public’s imagination, and new production techniques increased industrial output

  * Henry Ford and Mass Production
    * The assembly line reduced the price of Ford’s Model T car and made it affordable to the middle class
    * However, it took jobs away from skilled mechanics

  * The Impact of the Automobile
    * Automobiles grew more rapidly in the US than in other countries
    * The proliferation of the automobile industry, using mass production techniques, stimulated the growth of steel, chemical, oil, and glass-production industries
    * This also led to more Americans began to settle in suburban communities, and also led to “urban sprawl”

  * Scientific Management
    * Techniques developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor were key to mass production
    * He noted the most efficient techniques and made work more efficient, but also more monotonous
    * Many workers resisted this loss of autonomy

  * Advertising and Mass Consumption
    * The availability of consumer goods to the average family increased
    * The advertising industry also tapped into Freudian psychology, attempting to reach the public on a subconscious level

New Media and National and Regional Cultures

  * Radio and the Development of Mass Culture
    * Radio became an extremely popular medium by the end of the 1920s for music, sermons, weekly serials, comedians, and soap operas
    * Radio and movies tended to create a more homogeneous culture in the US in the 1930s

  * Movies and the Development of Mass Media
    * By the end of the 1920s, ¾ of the American people were going to movies every week
    * It continued to thrive during the Great Depression
    * Wizard of Oz, Marx brothers produced anarchic comedies which mocked authority figures and the pretensions of the wealthy
    * Charlie Chaplin’s comedy Modern Times satirized the entire capitalist system, from assembly line work to the corruption of the law enforcement system
    * The Grapes of Wrath chronicled conditions of Dust Bowl farmers migrating to California

  * Modern Media and Regional Culture
    * The spread of new technologies provided the technical means to record local and regional cultural forms and transmit them to wider audiences
    * Country music enjoyed broader appeal, as did gospel, blues, and ragtime

===== 1920s: Cultural and Political Controversies =====

Growth of the City

  * The Social Geography of the City
    * Immigrants continued to pour into the US for the first 2 decades of the 1900s, with a majority of the population of cities like NYC, Chicago, and San Fran. being made up of immigrants
    * The mechanization of agriculture lowered the demand for labor in rural areas, contributing to the internal migration of people into cities

  * New Opportunities for Women
    * Urbanization and industrialization provided new opportunities for women in the workforce
    * The most common occupation for women was in the field of domestic service in the 1850s, transforming to factory work and then finally to office work in the 1900s
    * The new woman of the 1920s was engaged in public issues, participating in the political struggles of the Progressive movement and gained new confidence in public issues
    * “Flappers” were independent-minded young women of the 1920s who openly defied Victorian moral codes about lady-like behavior

Nativism and the Quota System

  * The Growth of Nativism
    * The large wave of immigrants fueled a popular nativist movement
    * Some nativists focused on the fact that most new immigrants were not Protestant, that their language was associated with radical movements or drunkenness, that laborers would take jobs from native-born American workers, or that WWI contributed to German hatred

  * The Quota System
    * Nativism led to legislation that greatly reduced the number of immigrants allowed into the US
    * The Emergency Quota Act (1921) and the National Origins Act (1924) set quotas for new immigrants based on nationality
    * Stopped new immgration, there was no limits on immigration for natives of countries within the Americas

Migration Patterns and Cultural Production

  * The Harlem Renaissance
    * The Great Migration of African Americans contributed to the Harlem Renaissance - a literary, artistic, and intellectual movement centered in the primarily black neighborhood of Harlem, NYC
    * A key goal was to increase pride in black culture, and to forge a new cultural identity among African-American people
    * Writings of Langston Hughes and jazz of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington were part of the movement, as was the African-American national anthem: “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing” - James Weldon Johnson

  * The Literature of Dissent
    * The Lost Generation literary movement of the 1920s expressed a general disillusionment with society - troubled by the destruction and seeming meaningless of WWI
    * The Great Gatsby exposed the shallow lives of the wealthy, Sinclair Lewis’s novels mocked the emptiness of middle-class life, and Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms critiqued the glorification of war

  * Regionalism in the Context of Modernity
    * Regional cultures also flourished as a national culture emerged
    * Many historians see regionalism as a conscious response to the homogenizing forces of modern media and mass culture
    * Regionalist literature has its roots in the 19th century, most famously with Mark Twain, describing life along the Mississippi River
    * The most important Southern writer is William Faulkner, many of whose works are set in a fictional county in Mississippi (The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying)
    * Regionalism can also be seen in the Works Progress Administration - regionalist art in WPA murals and paintings
    * American Gothic

  * The “Okie” Migration and the Culture of Displacement
    * The movement of Dust Bowl refugees to California, and with them came their culture
    * The attitudes, politics, religious denominations, and dialects of Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, and Arkansas shaped the culture of agricultural centers in California’s Central Valley, most notably Bakersfield

  * Yiddish Theater
    * The migration of Eastern European Jews to the US gave rise to several cultural developments
    * Yiddish theater, often rivaling Broadway in scale and quality, was a major cultural force in the US with over 200 venues or touring performing groups
    * The center of Yiddish Theater was NYC, the district was centered in Jewish Lower East Side
    * These dramas explored populist approaches such as flamboyant acting and audience participation, but after WWI, they explored more serious themes

Culture Clashes in the 1920s

  * The Resurgence of the KKK
    * The original KKK, a violent, racist group with its roots in the Civil War had died out in the 1880s
    * However, in the 1920s, the organization was a genuine mass movement, devoted to white supremacy and 100% Americanism, evident in a number of race riots in the US

  * The Bible Versus Science
    * Many Americans developed a fundamentalist approach to the Bible and to religion
    * In the Scopes trial of 1925, Scopes, a biology teacher, was fined for violating the Butler Act, a state law forbidding the teaching of evolution

  * Rural and Urban Responses to Prohibition
    * The 18th Amendment banned the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages
    * However, this was short lived, as the consumption of alcohol reached pre-Prohibition levels by 1925
    * Furthermore, the lawlessness in America went up as bootleggers, speaksies, and organized crime filled the gap left by the end of the legitimate alcoholic beverage industry
    * Criminal activity became so widespread that Congress ratified the 21st Amendment which repealed Prohibition

===== The Great Depression =====

The Transition of the American Economy and Economic Instability

  * The Panic of 1893
    * Panic = economic downturn
    * As the economy became more consolidated after the Civil War, with only a handful of corporations controlling larger and larger segment of the economy, if only a few of those companies experienced downturns, the potential for a large-scale disruption to the economy became more likely
    * Panic of 1893 - worst economic depression before the Great Depression
    * Caused by the bankruptcy of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, then the failure of the National Cordage Company
    * This led to a major decline in stock prices, and led to a collapse of 500 banks, who invested their assets in the stock market
    * This led to the subsequent collapse of 15,000 businesses, 20% of the workforce was unemployed and a million had lost their jobs in 1894
    * The economy did not recover until 1901

  * The Panic of 1907
    * Several banks had invested in a scheme to gain control of the United Copper Company
    * However, when the scheme was unraveled, a large number of bank customers withdrew their deposits simultaneously over concerns of the bank’s solvency (company’s ability to pay back long term debt and meet financial obligations) - bank runs
    * One major NY bank, Knickerbocker Trust Company, collapsed, sending ripples of fear through banks and leading to a withdrawal of reserves (cash minimums that banks must have on hand)
    * This was partly calmed by J.P. Morgan, who offered to have US Steel take over a struggling steel industry rival that a major NY bank had invested in
    * However, the deal could not proceed until Morgan got assurances that Roosevelt and the government would not initiate antitrust action
    * This demonstrated the lack of control that the US government had over the industrial/financial world

Causes of the Great Depression

  * Overproduction and Underconsumption
    * The assembly line and scientific management vastly increased industrial output, and for much of the 1920s, the public was induced by easy credit and seductive advertising to absorb this increased output of goods
    * However, by 1927, consumption could not keep up with production
    * A weak labor movement led to stagnant wages, and ordinary Americans did not share in the economic expansion in the 1920s
    * By the late 1920s, manufacturers began laying off workers, worsening a bad situation

  * Problems on the Farm
    * During this time, the agricultural sector lagged behind the rest of the economy
    * Farmers increased production for WWI, but even afterwards, they were left in a cycle of debt, overproduction, and falling commodity prices
    * This was worsened by mechanization, increased tariff rates, and an isolationist foreign policy

  * An Inflated Stock Market
    * 1920s - people invested with borrowed money - buying stocks on margin, paying only 10% of the price up front with the promise of paying the remainder in the future
    * While this practice worked at first, it led to stock prices reaching new heights while the earnings of those corporations were declining, leading investors to sell stocks and incentivized panic selling
    * On Oct. 29, 1929, the stock market crashed

Hoover and the Great Depression

  * Rugged Individualism and Limited Government Intervention
    * Rather than expand federal intervention to address the Great Depression, Hoover invoked “rugged individualism” - the belief that the nation’s problems could best be solved by the people themselves, and when they were unable to, Hoover encouraged voluntary cooperation and private charities to step in
    * He started the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (1932), which extended loans to struggling railroads, banks, insurance companies, and other firms but not to individuals

  * The Bonus March and the Erosion of Confidence in Hoover
    * In June of 1932, a group of WWI veterans, who called themselves the Bonus Expeditionary Force, marched into Washington DC to demand a bonus that they had been promised for their service in the military
    * Hoover ordered the secretary of war to evacuate them, leading to the deaths of several veterans and hundreds of injuries
    * This reflected on Hoover, but most of the aggressive acts against the protestors were carried out by General Douglas MacArthur, against the orders of President Hoover

===== The New Deal =====

The Creation of the New Deal

  * Goals: Extend relief to the poor, Stimulate economic recovery, Create long-term reform of the American economy

  * From Hoover to FDR
    * FDR won governorship in NYC and introduced a number of innovative programs to help New Yorkers as the Great Depression Depended
    * He conveyed to the public a sense of empathy, and his openness to experimentation allowed for a more flexible response than Hoover
    * He won the election of 1932 and asserted that the USFG should take some responsibility for the welfare of the people
    * Previously, people received assistance from churches, settlement houses, and private charities, but the New Deal provided relief to individuals through variety of agencies

  * The First New Deal
    * FDR developed a remarkable array of programs during its first hundred days, which comprised the first New Deal - reflected his willingness to experiment and the scope of the problems that faced the nation
    * Glass-Steagall Act (1933)
      * Created the Federal Deposit insurance Corporation, which insured deposits so that in the case that a bank went bankrupt, people did not lose their savings
    * National Industrial Recovery Act (1933)
      * Designed to stabilize the industrial sector
      * Drew up a set of codes with representatives from labor corporations, designed to shorten hours, guarantee trade union rights, establish min. wage, regulate price of certain petroleum products, and promote fair business practices
      * Cutthroat competition hurt the economy and pushed workers’ wages down, which limited their ability to purchase goods
    * Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933)
      * Paid farmers to grow **fewer** crops
      * Agricultural Adjustment Act - reduce production to bolster sagging commodity prices and strengthen the agricultural sector
      * However, this often got tenant farmers and sharecroppers evicted, because landowners no longer needed as much land - hurting many of the nation’s poorest farmers
    * Tennessee Valley Authority (1933)
      * Built dams, generated electricity, manufactured fertilizer, provided technical assistance to farmers, and fostered economic development in the Tennessee Valley - regional planning
    * Federal Emergency Relief Act (1933)
      * Distributed more than $500 million to state and local governments, which would distribute aid to the poor
    * Civilian Conservation Corps (1933)
      * Provided outdoor work for young men between 18-24 - soil conservation, flood control, road building, bridges, and forest projects
      * Employed 2.75 million men
    * Securities and Exchange Commission (1934)
      * Created to oversee stock market operations by monitoring transactions, licensing brokers, limited buying on margin, and prohibiting insider trading

Critics of the New Deal and the Second New Deal

  * The Growth of the Commiunist Party
    * Although the communist movement never gained much traction in the US, there were some who saw the success of the USSR and felt that the capitalist system was not working
    * The Party attracted members by adopting the Popular Front strategy - drop talk of an impending revolution and to cooperate with a spectrum of anti-facist groups and governments, including the New Deal

  * Populist Opposition to the New Deal
    * Some criticized the New Deal as being overly cautious
    * Upton Sinclair (The Jungle) proposed sweeping, socialistic solutions; Townsend proposed a tax to generate enough money to give everyone over 60 a monthly stipend; Huey Long proposed breaking up the fortunes of the rich and distributing them to everyone else

  * The Growth of Organized Labor
    * National Industrial Recovery Act and Wagner Act legalized union membership in the US
    * By the end of WWII, went from 3 million in 1933 to 36% of American workers in unions

  * The Congress of Industrial Organizations
    * Drive to organize workers led to tensions within the labor movement
    * The 50 year old American Federation of Labor, had never shown much interest in organizing unskilled assembly-line workers
    * Labor leaders such as John L. Lewis organized the Committee for Industrial Organization within the AFL, which was later expelled by the AFL
    * They became the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), growing rapidly and surpassing the AFL

  * The Sit-down Strike
    * Although unions were legal, employers did not have to accept union demands
    * A new tactic by CIO unions was for workers to sit down in the shop floor, refusing to work and preventing the companies from hiring replacement workers (scabs)
    * Most famous strike - General Motors in Flint, Michigan (1936-1937)

  * Conservatives Critics Denounce Creeping Socialism
    * Some argued that the New Deal was socialism in disguise, the most prominent group on the right being American Liberty League - who promoted “open shop” - a business in which the employees are not required to join a union
    * Catholic priest Father Charles Coughlin used his popular national radio show to attack FDR as a commuinist and dictator

  * The Second New Deal
    * Although conditions were better than when he first took office, with more than 10 million Americans out of work, he could not claim the New Deal was a complete Success
    * In addition, SCOTUS declared the National Industrial Recovery Act unconstitutional because it used legislative powers in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States and the Agricultural Adjustment Act unconstitutional for using state powers (statutory regulations) in United States v. Butler
    * With pressure and a looming election, FDR introduced the Second New Deal, less about shaping different sectors of the economy and more about providing assistance and support to the working class

  * Works Progress Administration (1935)
    * The WPA created jobs for millions of unemployed, employing over 8 million by the time it shut down

  * Social Security Act (1935)
    * Designed to help the unemployed, elderly, and disabled
    * Retirement benefits were funded by taxes on workers and employers

  * The Wagner Act (1935)
    * Encouraged the formation of unions
    * Established the National Labor Relations Board to oversee union elections and arbitrate conflicts between workers and owners
    * Prohibited owners from taking punitive actions against workers who sought to organize unions
    * Led to a tremendous increase in union activity

  * The Second New Deal and the Court Packing Plan
    * FDR was worried that SCOTUS would invalidate parts of his Second New Deal, and proposed a bill to allow him to appoint 6 additional justices
    * It did not pass Congress, but the Court became friendlier to the president anyway where some conservative justices retired and FDR was able to appoint 7 new justices

  * The Rollback of the New Deal
    * Many historians believe the new direction FDR took hurt the economy
    * By 1937, the economy was showing signs of improvement, and FDR took the advice of some conservatives and cut back on spending

  * The Roosevelt Recession
    * His move to cut spending on the New Deal contributed to a further downturn in 1938 (“Roosevelt Recession”)
    * He later increased government spending, which helped, but real improvements came in 1939 as the US began producing arms and supplies in preparation for WWII

  * Keynesian Economics
    * When FDR cut back spending, he was rejecting the advice of economist John Maynard Keynes (General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money), who argued that deficit spending by the government was acceptable and desirable if it was stimulating the economy
    * The idea of using the tools of the government to influence economic activity is known as **Keynesian economics**
    * His theories influenced Democratic administrations, but Republicans focused on cutting government spending

The Legacy of the New Deal

  * Political Realignment
    * Hoover’s conservative laissez-faire approach has been echoed in the policies of Republican presidents like Reagan, H.W. Bush, W. Bush, while FDR’s liberal interventionist approach inspired Democratic president Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society”
    * Today, Democratic leaders debate how closely their party should be associated with New Deal liberalism

The Depression, the New Deal, and Affected Groups

  * African Americans
    * Hit hard by the economic difficulties of the 1930s - many New Deal programs ignored African Americans - such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which did not help tenant farmers
    * FDR was wary of losing the support of the southern wing of the Democratic Party, so he did not push for civil rights legislation or anti-lynching legislation
    * Despite his reluctance, African Americans switched from the party of Lincoln (Republicans) to the Democratic Party
    * This is because the First Lady and Interior Secretary championed civil rights, and because the president met periodically with a group of African American advisors, and finally because they believed that Roosevelt was attempting to improve conditions for poor and working-class people

  * The Scottsboro Boys Case
    * 9 African American youths were convicted of rape in Alabama on flimsy evidence
    * SCOTUS reversed most of the convictions, but the state courts again found them guilty, even after one of the victims admitted fabricating her story
    * Charges were dropped on four, the other five served prison time

  * Women
    * Suffered a double burden during the Depression - responsible for putting food on the table during difficult times, while on the other hand, they were frequently scorned if they “took a job away from a man” by working outside the home
    * Moreover, New Deal programs were not inclusive - the Civilian Conservation Corps excluded employing women, and the National Industrial Recovery Act set lower wage levels for women than men
    * Nevertheless, women such as Eleanor Roosevelt opened doors for women - more women were working outside the home in 1940 than in 1930

  * American Indians
    * New Deal - Indian Reorganization Act (1934) undid the Dawes Severalty Act (1887) which attempted to assimilate American Indians into mainstream society by breaking up reservations and dividing land into small plots for individual Indians
    * This Act restored tribal ownership of reservation lands and recognizing the legitimacy of tribal governments
    * The act also extended loans to American Indian groups for economic development

  * Mexican Americans and the Great Depression
    * Many Mexicans had moved to the southwest United States in the 1920s to work in agriculture, driven by opportunity as well as chaos caused by the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920)
    * They saw their wages plummet in the 1930s and New Deal programs did not help - the CCC and WPA excluded migrant farm workers by requiring a permanent address
    * Many Mexicans returned to their homeland - decreasing Mexican-American by almost 40% in the Great Depression

Economic Dislocation and Migrations in the Era of the New Deal

  * The Migration from the Dust Bowl to California
    * 1934-1937: parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and surrounding areas suffered from a major drought
    * Area became known as the “Dust Bowl” - caused by unsustainable over-farming coupled with a devastating drought
    * With the natural grass cover of the region removed, the fertile topsoil blew away when the drought struck
    * The Soil Conservation Service and USFG encouraged farmers to replant trees and grass, and purchased land to be kept out of cultivation

===== Interwar Foreign Policy =====

The Politics of Isolationism

  * Higher Tariff Rates - From Fordney-McCumber to Smoot-Hawley
    * Isolationist Republican presidents enacted higher tariffs to keep out foreign goods
    * The 1922 Fordney-McCumber Act dramatically raised tariff rates
    * In the midst of the Great Depression, isolationist legislators pushed through the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased tariffs to their second-highest rate in US history

  * The Washington Disarmament Conference
    * President Warren Harding successfully pressed for a reduction of naval power among Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and the US at this conference

  * The Kellogg-Briand Pact
    * One of 63 nations to sign this pact which renounced war in principle
    * Because it was negotiated outside of the League of Nations, it was unenforceable

  * The Good Neighbor Policy
    * In the 1920s, the US continued Roosevelt’s “Big Stick” approach in regard to Latin America, engaging in several military interventions in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti
    * Upon taking office in 1933, FDR began to pursue a more conciliatory policy in Latin America - Good Neighbor - to create more order in the hemisphere and less dislike
    * Secretary of State signed a declaration at the Inter-American Conference in Uruguay that no nation had the right to interfere in the affairs of another nation
    * In 1934, Roosevelt rejected an interventionist approach in regard to Cuba and worked to expand trade with Latin American through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (1934)

From Isolationism to Intervention

  * The Challenges of Isolationism in the 1930s
    * Mussolini and the Fascists took power in Italy in 1922, Hitler and the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, and Franco took power in Spain in 1939, as well as Japan falling under military rule
    * These dictatorial governments all took aggressive actions in the 1930s, and Great Britain and France declared war on Germany when it attacked Poland in 1939, beginning WWII
    * This made it hard for the US to maintain isolationism

  * The Continued Pull of Isolationism
    * Isolationists argued that the US should stay out of European affairs, taking WWI as a lesson
    * In addition, the Senate’s Nye Committee uncovered evidence that certain American corporations had profited greatly from US participation in WWI, which led Americans if these companies had pushed the country into the war

  * The Argument for Intervention
    * Many Americans believed it would be a mistake for the US to isolate itself from world affairs
    * Interventionists believed that if Britain were defeated, airplanes and submarines would bring Hitler’s war machine to the US
    * Many also believed that if Hitler was successful, civilization itself would be threatened

  * The Quarantine Speech and the Panay Incident
    * FDR argued that certain aggressive nations should be quarantined by the international community
    * The public response to this speech was generally negative, showing that the isolationist sentiment was still strong in the US
    * Even when Japan sank the USS Panay, isolationist political leaders urged FDR to accept Japanese apologies

  * The Onset of WWII
    * Soon after the war started, Roosevelt pushed for legislation allowing the US to send arms to Britain with the condition that Britain pay for the weapons first and transport them in their own ships
    * This “cash-and-carry” policy allowed the US to support Britain without the risk of US ships being destroyed

  * Steps Toward Engagement in WWII
    * US grew more interventionist as they saw the fall of France
    * In 1940, the US ratified the Selective Service Act, requiring compulsory military service for males between 21-35 years of age
    * By 1941, 70% of the American people were ready to help Britain directly, even if it risked getting involved in WWII
    * Congress approved the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed the US to send arms to Britain in American ships, and was extended to the USSR after Hitler broke the Nazi-Soviet Pact
    * FDR and Churchill solidified the alliance between the two countries through the Atlantic Charter

  * Pearl Harbor and American Intervention
    * Debates about intervention ended abruptly when Japanese warplanes attacked Pearl Harbor

===== World War II: Mobilization =====

Mobilizing for WWII

  * Rationing and Recycling
    * In 1942, the Office of Price Administration began rationing key commodities to civilians such as gasoline and tires
    * The government also rationed food - sugar, meat, coffee, lard, butter, etc.
    * Families received ration books and used ration stamps with cash when they purchased these items, and children would organize Tin Can Clubs to collect scrap metal to be melted down

  * Funding the War Effort
    * Paid for through war bonds and increases in taxes
    * The government went into massive debt during the war; however, WWII demonstrated that massive government spending can play a significant role in stimulating a sluggish economy

  * War Production - Becoming the Arsenal of Democracy
    * In 1942, FDR created the War Production Board and the Office of War mobilization to oversee war production
    * Almost overnight, unemployment of the 1930s ended - there were actually labor shortages
    * To ensure uninterrupted production, labor unions agreed to refrain from striking during the war [[APUSH%20Study%20Guide%20by%20Timchong%202830477d275d409da904b058926c01ac:image1|{{APUSH%20Study%20Guide%20by%20Timchong%202830477d275d409da904b058926c01ac:image1.png}}]] 

World War II and American Values

  * Rosie the Riveter
    * There was a government effort to recruit women to participate in the war effort for factories
    * Rosie the Riveter was a fictional character in order to present female workers in a positive light
    * This campaign was successful and by 1945, ⅓ of the workforce was female

  * WWII and the Status of African Americans in American Society
    * African Americans, during WWII, mounted direct challenge to Jim Crow segregation, both through their participation in the armed forces and in war-related industries
    * They put the issue of race on the national agenda

  * African Americans and War Production
    * Although war industries were reluctant to hire African Americans, African American labor leader Randolph planned a public demonstration in DC to protest discrimination
    * FDR issued Executive Order 8802, banning discrimination in war-related industries
    * The Great Migration continued, with African Americans moving toward industrial centers

  * The Japanese Relocation
    * In 1942, FDR issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the government to remove more than 100,000 Japanese Americans (both American born and immigrants) and place them into camps
    * SCOTUS ruled in Korematsu v. United States that the relocation was acceptable on the grounds of national security

Migration and Mobilization

  * Mexicans and WWII
    * The Bracero program was initiated to bring temporary contract workers from Mexico - and the Mexican government pushed the US to guarantee that these workers would not be drafted
    * More than 200,000 Mexicans participated, however, they were the object of discrimination, harassment, and violence during WWII

===== World War II: Military =====

The Stakes Involved in WWII

  * The Nazi Regime and the Holocaust
    * In 1939, Hitler began his execution for the final solution of the Jewish question - the Holocaust, which also included Slavic people, gypsies, the disabled, and homosexuals
    * They were organized into ghettos, then moved to concentration camps where they would be killed

  * The American Response to the Holocaust
    * American officials resisted pleas to admit large numbers of Jewish refugees fleeing Europe
    * In 1939, German ship St. Louis carrying nearly 1000 escaped German Jews, was turned away by the US
    * Such resistance to refugees continued during the war

  * Japanese Wartime Atrocities
    * Americans saw Japanese wartime actions as a militarist ideology that threatened to undermine democratic traditions
    * The Nanjing Massacre (Rape of Nanking) ocurred in 1937, where Japanese troops killed thousands of civilians in China, resulting in 80,000-300,000 deaths

Staffing the Military During WWII - Opportunities and Debate

  * Staffing the Military
    * FDR administration looked to staff the military even before Pearl Harbor
    * The Selective Service Act, passed in September 1940, created the first peacetime draft in US history
    * By 1941, 1 ½ million men were in the armed forces

  * Women in the Military
    * Many women served as nurses, and more than 150,000 joined the Women’s Army Corps

  * African Americans in the Armed Forces - The “Double V Campaign”
    * The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People encouraged African Americans to take part in the “Double V” campaign - victory against facism abroad and victory against racism in the US
    * The most famous segregated black units were the Tuskegee Airmen and the 761st Tank Battalion
    * Their effectiveness on the battlefield encouraged Truman to desegregate the armed services in 1948 with Executive Order 9981

The Allied Victory over the Axis Powers in WWII

  * War in the Pacific Theater
    * Although the defeat of Hitler was a top priority for the US, it was Japan that had directly attacked the US, causing them to send more troops to Japan than Europe
    * By 1942, Japan controlled a massive Pacific empire, causing setbacks for US forces

  * The Battles of Coral Sea and Midway
    * The US turned the tide of war in the Pacific with these two battles
    * After Midway, the US steadily began to push Japanese forces back toward the Japanese home islands

  * Island Hopping
    * This strategy was employed by the US to capture key Japanese-held islands
    * They would avoid attacking some of the most heavily fortified islands, and focus on islands that were most important - such as airfields, or key positions to block or attack enemy naval movements
    * The US cut off islands it had hopped over by blockading supply ships

  * War in Europe
    * Before 1944, most of the fighting against Germany was carried out by the USSR and Stalin
    * He urged the US and Britain to open a second front in Western Europe against Germany

  * The Washington and Casablanca Conferences
    * FDR and Churchill met twice to discuss strategy, agreeing not to invade through France but to open a front in North Africa, followed by an attack on the “soft underbelly” of the Axis - Italy

  * Fighting in North Africa
    * By 1943, North Africa was in Allied hands, with some of Hitler’s best troops defeated by British forces and American forces led by Eisenhower

  * The “Soft Underbelly” of the Axis
    * ¼ million Allied troops landed in Sicily in 1943
    * They captured the city and dismissed Mussolini, and Italy’s new government left the Axis and joined the Allies
    * Germany was not ready to accept this, and Hitler sent reinforcements into Italy
    * Allies finally marched into Rome in 1944, but the rest of the advance up Italy was defended by German troops; Italy was no soft underbelly

  * D-Day and the Allied Assault on Europe
    * In 1944, the Allies stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, and began pushing Hitler’s forces back toward Germany
    * On D-Day, nearly 200,000 Allied troops landed with more than 1 million troops arriving over the next weeks
    * By August, Eisenhower and Allied forces liberated Paris from Nazi occupation

  * V-E Day
    * Hitler made one last attempt to stop the Allied assault; where German forces counterattacked Allied lines in Belgium in the Battle of the Bulge
    * American and British troops approached Germany from the west as Soviet troops approached from the east
    * On April 30, Hitler committed suicide, and on May 7, Germany surrendered: Victory in Europe Day

  * Victory in the Pacific
    * By 1945, American forces had taken control of most of Japan’s Pacific empire
    * More than 7,000 Americans in the battle for Iwo Jima, and the struggle for Okinawa was even more deadly - approximately 12,000 Americans died while Japan lost 140,000

  * The Decision to Drop the Atomic Bomb, and the Japanese Surrender
    * Truman succeeded FDR after his sudden death
    * The US used the atomic bomb twice on Japan - on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
    * 226,000 people died, and Japan swiftly surrendered
    * The atomic bomb did not generate much public debate at the time, as it ended a bloody conflict that had consumed 50 million lives
    * Critics now argue that the Japanese were on the verge of surrender

===== Postwar Diplomacy =====

The United States and the Postwar World

  * Tehran Conference
    * Stalin, Churchill, and FDR met in Tehran, Iran, in November 1943
    * They agreed to launch D-Day with a Society offensive, and Stalin pledged that the Soviet Union would join the war in Asia following the defeat of Germany
    * They agreed to forming an international peacekeeping organization (in theory)

  * Bretton Woods Conference
    * 44 nations met to discuss the basis of the global economy
    * The International Monetary Fund was established at this meeting

  * Yalta Conference
    * Most significant, and last, meeting of Churchill, Stalin, and FDR
    * They agreed to divide Germany into 4 military zones of occupation (the fourth occupied by France)
    * Stalin also allowed free elections in Poland, and was secretly allowed control of Outer Mongolia, the Kuril Islands, parts of Sakhalin Island, as well as Soviet railroad rights in Manchuria
    * Critics later FDR and Churchill for abandoning Poland and Eastern Europe to Communist forces
    * However, there was little they could do to dislodge the Red Army from Eastern Europe without starting an all out war

  * Potsdam Conference
    * The final meeting between these three countries was attended by Truman and Atlee (successor to Churchill)
    * They resolved the denazification of Germany, which led to the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials against the Nazis
    * Many defended themselves by claiming that they were merely following orders

===== Subject to Debate =====

  * The Nature of American Imperialism
    * Critics often discuss the US as if it were a “colossus”, imposing its will on the world - protecting democracy is an excuse for its economic exploitation
    * Others hold a “realpolitik” approach that America must expand if it wants to maintain its current standard of living
    * A third view is the “international good guy” approach - that the US is truly driven by altruism

  * Progressivism and Progressive Historians
    * There are some questions to be raised about the movement - its assumptions, its effectiveness, and its relationship to Jim Crow policies

  * The Progressive Movement and the Business Community
    * Industry leaders initiated reform in the meat-packing industry to restore confidence in their industry
    * Another critique of the Progressive movement was their attitude toward the poor - trying to impose their idea of proper behavior on others
    * Ex. Prohibition - telling working class people they should not drink, this crusade against immoral behavior raises the issue of elitism

  * WWI in Public Memory
    * WWII is characterized as a good fight carried about by the greatest generation, whereas WWI is tucked away into a corner
    * One of the reasons that WWI is ignored, is that there is no clearly identifiable “evil” that the US was trying to defeat - this does not read like a morality play
    * As the war ended in 1919, America became violently conservative - the “Red Scare” was paving the way for the resurgence of the KKK, restrictions on immigration, and attacks on secularism

  * Consensus Historians and Intolerance in the 1920s
    * According to them, Americans share a belief in democracy and individual liberties, they believe that hard work leads to advancement, but do not try to impose their beliefs on others - they are a tolerant people
    * They would argue that the labor battles of the Gilded Age was not a battle between the high and low classes, but rather that they were strikers wanting a greater share of the wealth that the economy was generating
    * They have a great deal of difficulty explaining the 1920s and the KKK - 3 million Americans joined a violent, racist, intolerant, anti-Semitic organization - difficult to fit into the traditional consensus model of American history

  * Handling the Great Depression: Hoover vs. FDR
    * Hoover is not as incompetent as he is often portrayed
    * When the Depression hit, he implemented the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which provided needed funds to key sectors of the economy
    * Critics portray the New Deal as creeping socialism

  * The New Deal - Successful or Ineffective?
    * Some historians noted that the New Deal did not solve the problems of the Depression
    * Historians also note that the Depression only ended when the US began producing materials for WWII
    * Others argue that the New Deal restored hope among the American people and prevented more widespread suffering
    * Organized labor also made great strides because of New Deal legislation

  * Mortality and Justice in the WWII Era
    * Some historians insist that the US could have done more to save European Jews, such as allowing ships carrying refugees to dock
    * The debate over the use of the atomic bomb is also controversial, considering that Japan was likely ready to surrender by the time the bomb was used

===== Period 8 =====

===== The Cold War from 1945 to 1980 =====

Forging a New Foreign Policy In the Postwar World

  * They sought to contain Communism by building a system of international security, maintaining a stable global economy, and bolstering non-Communist states

  * Origins of the Cold War
    * Tensions existed between the US and the USSR from the Russian Revolution, when America opposed the Bolsheviks
    * The Cold War began from the end of WWII
    * The US believed the Soviets were intent upon extending their control over Europe - as the war ended, the USSR left its Red Army troops occupying Eastern Europe where the countries became Soviet satellites, and they installed a puppet regime in Poland where they said they would allow free elections

  * Containment and the Truman Doctrine
    * Truman issued the Truman Doctrine (1947) in which he said the goal of the US was to contain Communism
    * The containment approach was spelled out in an article in Foreign Affairs “Sources of Soviet Conduct”, aka the “X Article”
    * Later it was learned that George Kennan, a diplomat who had served in the US embassy in Moscow, wrote the article - however, he later reversed himself and recommended dialogue with the USSR
    * However, the Cold war had begun

  * Military Aid to Greece and Turkey
    * As a part of containment, the US extended aid to Greece and Turkey, helping the Greek monarchy put down a Communist-influenced rebel movement movement
    * This quieted Republican criticism of Truman and allowed him to win reelection the following year

  * The Marshall Plan
    * Developed by Secretary of State Marshall, the plan allocated almost $13 billion for war-torn Europe to rebuild
    * West Germany, France, and Britain received the bulk of it, and this stabilized the capitalist economies of Western Europe

  * The Berlin Blockade and the Berlin Airlift
    * In 1948, the US decided to challenge the Soviet blockade of the Western-occupied section of Berlin
    * This enclave, occupied by Allied troops after WWII, was cut off from the West within Communist-controlled East Germany
    * The goal was for the USSR to cut off West Berlin’s food and supplies and make it part of East Germany
    * Over the next year, Truman sent more than 278,000 flights to supply western Berlin - “Berlin Airlift” - prevented the USSR from taking over the city

  * The Formation of NATO
    * The crisis over Berlin caused the US, Canada, and Western Europe to form a mutual defense pact
    * NATO was formed to resist any aggressive actions by the Soviet Union and created a standing army for this purpose
    * This was the first time the US joined a formal peacetime alliance
    * In response, the USSR formed an alliance with the COmmunist countries of Eastern Europe - the Warsaw Pact
    * Many countries that had been part of the Warsaw Pact joined NATO over the course of the Cold War

Carrying out the Policy of Containment

  * NSC-68
    * A National Security Council Paper, known as NSC-68, called for a more aggressive defense policy for the United States
    * It asserted that the US must assume a sole leadership position among the non-Communist nations
    * It recommended raising taxes and devoting more funds to military spending - largely shaping US foreign policy during the Cold War

  * The Cold War in Asia
    * The US successfully ushered Japan toward democracy and economic self-sufficiency
    * It also granted independence to the Philippines in 1946, however, Communist China was a difficult problem for Truman

  * Communism in China
    * China had been roiled by an ongoing civil war in the 1930s
    * After WWII, the US allied with the Nationalist side led by Jiang Jieshi
    * However, the Communist Party, led Mao Zedong amassed a huge following among the poor, rural population of China
    * Mao’s forces won in 1949 and the People’s Republic of China was established - the news that one of the biggest nations in the world had become Communist shocked many Americans who accused Truman of losing China

  * The Korean War (1950-53)
    * Korea had been divided at the 38th parallel after WWII, with the US administering the southern half, and the USSR administering the northern half
    * In 1948, they became North and South Korea
    * In 1950, North Korean troops, using Soviet equipment, invaded South Korea
    * United Nations forces, led by US General MacArthur pushed North Korean forces into North Korea, but China pushed back 150,000 troops over the Yalu River to push them back, settling on the 38th Parallel

  * The Firing of General MacArthur
    * During the Korean War, MacArthur made it clear that he thought the United States could invade China and roll back Communism
    * Truman was convinced that a wider war, so soon after WWII, would be disastrous and fired MacArthur for insubordination

  * Armistice in Korea
    * An armistice was reached and the Korean ended as it began - divided at the 38th Parallel

  * President Eisenhower, the “New Look” in Foreign Policy, and “Massive Retaliation”
    * Eisenhower pursued a policy labeled the “New Look” - emphasizing the development of strategic nuclear weapons as a deterrent to potential threats from the USSR
    * “Massive Retaliation” was an idea put forth by Secretary of State Dulles - designed to deter conventional as well as nuclear strikes by the USSR
    * Brinkmanship was the idea that the USSR needed to be aware that the USSR was willing to go to the brink of war with its nuclear arsenal
    * MAD

  * The Launching of Sputnik
    * Race for supremacy → exploration of outer space/space race
    * The Russians got to space first with Sputnik, which alarmed US officials, because this could be used to deliver atomic weapons to any location on Earth

  * The Space Race
    * After, the US created NASA after Sputnik (1958), and Kennedy announced the goal of landing a man on the moon
    * The goal was accomplished in 1969, when the US was the first nation to successfully land a spacecraft and men on the moon

  * Espionage and the U-2 Incident
    * The US maintained an extensive program of spying on the military capabilities of the Soviet Union
    * At first, the government denied the program existed, but in 1960, a high-altitude U-2 spy plane was shot down over Soviet territory
    * Eisenhower admitted the program existed and defended its goals

  * Cuban Missile Crisis
    * 1962 when a U-2 spy plane discovered that Cuba was preparing bases for installing Soviet nuclear missiles
    * Kennedy declared these missiles to be unacceptable and demanded that the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, halt the operation and withdraw, whereas Khrushchev insisted the USSR had the right to install these missiles
    * Finally, a deal was reached where the USSR would abandon its Cuban missile program and the United States would recognize Cuba’s sovereignty (The US also agreed to remove missiles from Turkey)

The Cold War - From Confrontation to Detente

  * Eisenhower and Khrushchev Pursue Coexistence
    * Eisenhower and Khrushchev held a summit after the death of Stalin, however, the launch of Sputnik and the Soviet test of an ICBM pushed the two nations further apart
    * Just before Khrushchev and Eisenhower had scheduled a summit to sign a nuclear test ban, but just before they met, the American U-2 spy plane was shot down in the USSR, scuttling any potential argument

  * US Soviet Relations Under Kennedy
    * In wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Partial Test Ban Treaty was signed by the US
    * The ban exempted underground nuclear tests

  * Detente with China and the USSR
    * Nixon’s policy of detente represented a thawing in the Cold War and an improvement of relations with the USSR
    * In 1971, Nixon initiated an agreement with the USSR where they accepted the independence of West Berlin and the US recognized East Germany
    * The 1972 Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) led to two arms-control agreements, and although tensions existed, detente led to discussions between two sides and to cultural exchanges
    * In 1972, Nixon visited China, making it the first time an American president visited the People’s Republic of China

===== The Red Scare =====

Containment and the Domestic Red Scare

  * The Strike Wave of 1946 and the Taft-Hartley Act (1947)
    * Immediately after WWII, the US experienced the largest strike wave in history (5 million workers)
    * Unions, who had refrained from striking during the war, feared that the gains they made during the war would be taken away
    * This was largely successful, boosting wages for factor workers and allowing them to partake in consumer culture
    * The Taft-Hartley Act was designed to monitor and restrict the activities of organized labor, making it more difficult to strike
    * It also let states pass “right to work” laws, banning union shops (workplaces where all workers were required to join a union if voted by the majority)
    * It also required union leaders to pledge they were not Communists

  * Federal Employee Loyalty and Security Program (1947)
    * Barred Communists and fascists from serving in federal government positions
    * Executive Order 9835 also allowed investigations to be held for current employees - forcing them to promise to uphold the Constitution and to swear they were not Communists

  * The McCarran Internal Security Act (1950)
    * Mandated that Communist groups in the US register with the government, allowing for the arrest of suspected security risks during national emergencies
    * Truman saw this as a threat to civil liberty and vetoed it, however, Congress passed it over his veto

  * Senator Joseph McCarthy
    * A Republican senator from Wisconsin, he rose to national prominence in 1950 when he announced he had a list of 205 “known Communists” who were working in the State Department
    * Although this number was later reduced to 57, he encouraged a mindset where people began to suspect those around them as Communists
    * The anti-Communist movmement of the 1950s is often referred to as McCarthyism

  * The Attack on Hollywood
    * Anti-communist Senate and House members put effort into investigating the film and broadcast industries, fearing that Communists would subtly get their messages out via media
    * In 1947, several famous directors and writers were called (“Hollywood Ten”) to testify in Washington but refused, citing the 1st Amendment
    * These ten, and others who refused to cooperate, were blacklisted, preventing them from finding work in Hollywood

  * The Threat of Nuclear War
    * Many Americans, because of the Cold War and conventional proxy wars, built bomb shelters in their basements or backyards
    * There were civil defense programs to build public bomb shelters and prepare the population for a nuclear emergency

  * Duck and Cover
    * The government issued a series of air-raid drills in public schools
    * When an alarm sounded, students would be ushered to a fallout shelter or be ordered to duck and cover

  * The Rosenberg Case
    * Many were convinced that Communists in the US provided the USSR with information, leading them to build and test a nuclear bomb in 1949
    * The Rosenbergs were an American couple (members of the Communist Party) accused of such
    * They insisted on their innocence but were sent to the electric chair

  * The Smith Act and the Communist Party
    * Government prosecutors used the WWII Smith Act to arrest leading members of the Communist Party in several states on the grounds they conspired to organize the overthrow of the government by force
    * Between 1949-1957, more than 140 Communists were arrested, including their leader Eugene Dennis

  * The Fall of McCarthyism
    * Eventually, critics asserted that some anti-Communist measures violated people’s constitutional right to freedom of speech
    * McCarthy himself went too far, accusing members of the military establishment of being members of the Communist Party
    * After finding his accusations were baseless, the Senate vowed to censure McCarthy in 1954, ending this “witch hunt”
    * In Yates v. United States (1957), SCOTUS overturned the convictions of Communists that had been found guilty under the Smith Act

===== The Economy after 1945 =====

The Growth of the Middle Class

  * The GI Bill
    * Also known as the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act (1944), this provided low-interest loans for veterans to purchase homes and attend college

  * The Baby Boom
    * For several years before 1946, the birthrate was relatively low, due to the Great Depression and WWII
    * However, the return of veterans soon led to many more children
    * This baby boom would require states to spend more money on public education in the 1950s-60s and on expanding college enrollment in the 1960s-70s

  * Childrearing in the 1950s
    * The parents of the baby boom generation were enthusiastic readers of child-rearing guides
    * The most influential was Benjamin Spock’s Baby and Child Care (1946)
    * This book urged parents to treat children as individuals, let them develop at their own pace, and to focus less on discipline and more on affection
    * Conservative critics cited this book and causing baby boomers to join the counterculture movement of the 1960s (hippies)

Suburban Growth and the Rise of the Sun Belt

  * The Growth of Suburbia
    * A series of factors after the war contributed to the unprecedented growth of these communities
    * There was a housing crunch created by all the returning WWII soldiers, many of whom married and had children and were looking for affordable housing
    * Many white people also did not want to live in the urban neighborhoods with the African Americans that had migrated in search of work - the move to suburbia is coined “white flight”

  * Levittown and Suburban Development
    * Innovative developer William Levitt, president of Lefitt and Songs, took large tracts of land outside major cities and built huge developments of nearly identical, modest houses
    * His company applied the techniques of mass production, building these houses rapidly and cheaply, Levittown becoming synonymous with these mass-produced communities
    * There were also critics of these communities - monotonous life

  * The Interstate Highway Act
    * Highway initiatives made suburbia attractive, as one could drive into cities from the suburbs quickly
    * The National Interstate and Defense Highways Act (1956) allowed the government to initiate a massive highway building project that resulted in the interstate highway system
    * The act was also promoted as a defense measure, allowing for the rapid movement of military equipment and personnel

  * White Flight and the Decline of Older Cities
    * As middle-class families left urban centers, cities saw their tax bases shrink dramatically
    * With scarce funds, cities had to cut back on basic services such as policing and education, leading to more crime and leading more middle class families to move out
    * By the 1960s, entire sections of cities became slums

  * Urban Renewal
    * To address the decline of older cities, the government developed a set of initiatives called the urban renewal program
    * A central piece was the Title I: Housing Act of 1949, which provided federal financing for slum clearance programs
    * However, this program displaced thousands of urban residents, and frequently, nothing was built to replace the demolished neighborhoods
    * Low income urban housing projects often proved to simply breed crime and unsanitary conditions, and Title I was often used to clear land to build highways rather than additional housing
    * Most cities were left in a worse shape than before the programs

===== Culture After 1945 =====

Cultural Conformity and Its Discontents

  * Conformity in a Conservative Decade
    * There were societal pressures toward conformity in the 1950s
    * Part of this is due to the Cold War and McCarthyism - many Americans were intimidated and were reluctant to appear nonconformist
    * Americans were more eager to mold their ideas to societal standards than think independently
    * Whyte’s The Organization Man (1956) described the modern corporation where employees were expected to think like a group
    * Wilson’s The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1955) depicted a businessman trapped in the materialistic commercial world of the 1950s
    * J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye (1951) railed at the “phonies” who had achieved success in mainstream 1950s society (against conformity)

  * Television
    * By the end of the 1950s, nearly 90% of American homes owned a television
    * The most emblematic genre of the 50s was the sitcom - with a wise father figure, stay home mother, and obedient children such as Leave It to Beaver and Father Knows Best
    * There were also westerns and soap operas - many genres carrying over from the radio
    * The Ed Sullivan Show, a variety show which aired from 1948-71 became a cultural touchstone for millions of Americans every Sunday evening

  * Rock ‘n’ Roll Music
    * Extremely popular among young people in the 50s, it was developed primarily in the African-American community
    * It was dubbed “race music” and was deemed dangerous by mainstream white commentators, fearing that it would encourage racial mixing as well as sexually-suggestive dancing
    * Presley became a huge cultural force in America, following in the footsteps of African-American performers
    * This music was part of a distinct youth culture ushering in a generational divide in American society

  * Beat Generation Literature
    * The beats represented a rejection of mainstream social values - the suburban lifestyle, the consumer society, patriotism
    * On the Road, by Jack Kerouac (1957) is a stream of consciousness screed, depicting a life of spontaneity and freedom
    * Ginsberg’s book, Howl and Other Poems (1956) ripped apart at the foundations of Cold War, materialistic American society

  * Abstract Expressionism
    * Centered in NYC, this movement emphasized spontaneity, emotion, and intensity over realistic reproductions of the visible world
    * The most famous was Jackson Pollock

===== Early Steps in the Civil Rights Movement (1940s and 50s) =====

Origins, Strategies, and Tactics of the Civil Rights Movement

  * The Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s
    * Blossomed in the 1950s; it challenged both the legal basis of segregation and the pervasive racism in society - the racism that had justified slavery and the persistence of Jim Crow segregation
    * A more receptive federal government gave support and backing to civil rights activism
    * It forced America to examine its most cherished institutions and reevaluate ingrained patterns of thought
    * At the same time, there was an intense backlash among whites in the South

  * WWII and the Origins of the Civil Rights Movement
    * WWII was a transformative experience for blacks - many returning soldiers who had taken part in the Double V campaign felt a sense of empowerment and engagement
    * The injustices of American life seemed reprehensible to men who had just risked their lives serving their country
    * In addition, the migration from rural to urban centers strengthened their appetite for change and justice

  * Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-56)
    * The catalyst for the boycott was Rosa Parks, an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who refused to give up her seat to a white person
    * Although this was not the first time this had happened, civil rights leaders thought the time was right and used her as a public persona for the campaign against segregation
    * The movement created the Montgomery Improvement Association to direct the campaign and selected MLK to head the organization

  * MLK Jr. and Nonviolent Civil Disobedience
    * He soon became the central figure in the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s
    * He advocated civil disobedience to directly challenge unjust practices, rather than violence

Government Responses to Civil Rights Activism

  * Truman and Civil Rights
    * He was an early supporter of civil rights, creating the Committee on Civil Rights and issuing Executive Order 9981 (banning segregation in the military)
    * However, he felt he should not go too far because he would lose the support of southern Democrats

  * A Favorable Supreme Court
    * This iteration was far more liberal than in 1896 when it issued Plessy v. Ferguson
    * The NAACP and its lead lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, thought the time was right to bring a key civil rights case to the court

  * The Case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954)
    * Reverend Brown’s daughter had to go to school a mile away rather than the nearby white school
    * There was evidence showing the psychological impact of segregation (Brandeis Brief)
    * SCOTUS ruled that the separate but equal doctrine of Plessy had to end, and that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal
    * This was a great encouragement to the civil rights movement, believing that the government was in favor of civil rights, however, they were met with opposition by southern whites

Challenges for the Civil Rights Movement

  * Massive Resistance in Little Rock Crisis and Beyond
    * There was a violent backlash by many southern whites
    * An example was in Little Rock, where authorities allowed 9 black students to enroll in Central High School
    * Governor Faubus refused to cooperate, which led to mob action and violence outside the high school
    * He sent the National Guard to bar them from entering the school, and when this reached national news coverage, Eisenhower sent federal troops
    * However, Eisenhower’s administration was very reluctant to take action in regard to civil rights for African Americans in general

===== America as a World Power =====

United States Actions in Latin America

  * Regime Change in Guatemala
    * In Guatemala, the US orchestrated the ousting of the democratically elected Jacobo Arbenz in 1954
    * He was a reform minded leader who began a land redistribution program
    * He was looking to nationalize some of the landholdings of the American-owned United Fruit Company, who grew Chiquita bananas
    * He planned to nationalize lands that were not under cultivation and buy them to distribute them to poverty-stricken peasants
    * The company refused and the CIA organized a coup, training an opposition army, that would oust Arbenz and install a military dictatorship in his place
    * The bitter feelings left contributed to civil war in Guatemala that lasted until the 90s

  * Hostilities with Cuba
    * From 1933-59, Cuba had been run as a military dictatorship with close ties to the US, but in 1959, Castro overthrew the government
    * Since then, the US and Cuba grew further apart while Cuba got closer to the USSR
    * In the final months of the Eisenhower administration, carrying over into Kennedy who adopted the plan, the US trained, armed, and aided a group of Cuban exiles to overthrow Castro
    * They landed in the Bay of Pigs in 1961, but were quickly captured by Cuban forces

  * Intervention in the Dominican Republic
    * Just before Vietnam, Johnson intervened in the Dominican Republic, whose repressive military ruler, General Trujilo, had been assassinated in 1961
    * In 1965, when it appeared that left nationalist leader, Juan Bosch, might ascend to power, Johnson dispatched 30,000 Marines claiming that Bosch was a Communist

The Military-Industrial Complex and the Arms Race

  * The Military Industrial Complex
    * Popularized by Eisenhower, the term implied a close-knit relationship between government officials, military leaders, and corporate interests
    * Policy decisions might be made to advance the interests of the military industrial complex, which might be at odds with other foreign policy goals

  * Challenging America’s Nuclear Policy
    * Even before people protested America’s military involvement in Vietnam, some were critical of America’s nuclear weapons policy
    * Policymakers had to accept MAD, but organizations such as the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE) in 1957 challenged the nuclear tests of the Eisenhower Administration
    * In 1961, the newly formed Women’s Strike for Peace inspired more than 50,000 women to march for peace

Decolonization, Nationalism, and US Policy in the Middle East and Africa

  * Decolonization and US Foreign Policy
    * A wave of nationalist movements developed throughout Asia and Africa
    * For example, India gained independence in a movement led by Gandhi
    * US foreign policy evolved - on one hand, the US professed support for the concept of self-determination, granting the Philippines independence in 1946, but on the other hand, it had strong ties with many European powers who had colonies
    * As the Cold War intensified, the Truman and Eisenhower administrations became concerned that the newly independent countries would end up in the orbit of the USSR
    * The US encouraged European powers to negotiate with their colonies to ensure peaceful paths to independence
    * The US also established the Peace Corps in 1961 to extend aid packages and assistance to these countries, also resorting to military force and covert operations to install regimes favorable to US interests

  * Iran and the CIA
    * In 1951, the left leaning, reform-minded Mohammad Mosaddegh was elected prime minister, and he nationalized oil fields and refineries, angering Western oil interests
    * He also challenged Iran’s hereditary ruler Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, who was close to Western Oil interests
    * Eisenhower authorized the CIA, with the support of the MI6 agents, to instigate a coup against Mosaddegh, restoring the Shah’s power
    * This event would later come back to haunt the US a generation later in the aftermath of the 1979 Iranian Revolution

  * The Eisenhower Doctrine
    * Eisenhower, becoming concerned about events in the Middle East after Colonel Nasser took power in Egypt, after the ousting of King Farouk (who was close to Great Britain)
    * Nasser established close relations with the USSR and seized control of the British and French owned Suez Canal
    * Eisenhower, the UN, and the USSR pressured France, Great Britain, and Israel invading Egypt to retake control of the canal to withdraw
    * Afterward, Eisenhower pledged he would support any Middle Eastern country threatened by “any nation controlled by international Communism”
    * It was invoked in 1958 when a rebel movement friendly to Nasser emerged in Lebanon

===== The Vietnam War =====

The War in Vietnam

  * Background to American Involvement in Vietnam
    * From mid 1800s - mid 1900s, Indochina, including Vietnam, was a French possession
    * It was occupied by Japan during WWII, and then reoccupied by France when the Japanese left
    * A resistance movement led by Ho Chi Minh defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu, and france withdrew
    * Vietnam was divided at the 17th parallel between COmmunist North Vietnam, led by Ho Chi Minh, and Western South Vietnam
    * Rebel fighters, known as the Vietcong, fought to defeat a corrupt and dictatorial South Vietnam
    * American observers concluded that, without outside help, South Vietnam would likely fall to the Communists

  * The Domino Theory
    * It asserts that when a nation adopts Communism, its neighbors are likely to become Communist as well
    * This presumes that Communism is imposed on a country from outside, not developing as a result of internal conditions

  * The US Sends Advisors to Vietnam
    * US aid went to South Vietnam to fight anti-government rebels

  * The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution
    * Johnson announced in 1964 that American destroyers had been fired upon by North Vietnamese gunboats in the Gulf of Tonkin, which was questionable, but it gave Johnson a blank check to engage in military operations without a formal declaration of war
    * This can be considered the beginning of the Vietnam War

  * The Tet Offensive
    * This was a major attack on South Vietnamese, US, and allied bases and towns by the Vietcong in 1968
    * This left 9,000 allied forces dead, and 40,000 Vietcong dead
    * The offensive was defeated, but it demonstrated the ability of the Vietcong to organize a coordinated strike in South Vietnamese territory

  * The My Lai Massacre
    * In 1968, a company of American troops killed almost everyone in the village of My Lai despite finding no enemy forces
    * In 1971, Lieutenant William Calley was found guilty of the massacre, which led many Americans to question the morality of the war

  * Vietnamization of the Vietnam War
    * Nixon promised the people that he had a plan for peace with honor in the war when he ran for president
    * However, he widened the war to Cambodia, beginning a policy of Vietnamization - replacing American troops with South Vietnamese troops
    * Nixon could not lead american forces to victory, so the US pulled out in 1973, and by 1975, South Vietnam was defeated and Vietnam was reunited as a Communist Country

Debates Over Executive Power

  * The War Powers Act
    * Many members of Congress were frustrated with the actions of both presidents during the war - Johnson and Nixon
    * They considered Nixon expanding the war into Cambodia and Laos taking away Congress’s authority to declare war
    * The War Powers Act (1973) was an attempt to check presidential power, requiring the president to report any troop deployments to Congress and giving them the ability to force the withdrawal of US troops after 60 days

===== The Great Society =====

Poverty Amid Affluence

  * Abundance in Postwar America
    * America saw unprecedented growth in GDP from 1945-1960, from $200 → $500 billion
    * There was a dramatic rise in the middle class - home and car ownership, a college education, and a comfortable income

  * The Other America
    * Harrinton’s The Other America: Poverty in the US (1962) revealed the existence of pervasive poverty in society to Americans, including Kennedy
    * He noted that many of the technological advancements associated with economic growth resulted in job displacement and 50 million Americans living in poverty - in decaying urban slums or rural towns
    * This helped the domestic agendas of Kennedy and Johnson

The Liberal Agenda in the 1960s

  * The Elements of 1960s Liberalism
    * Liberalism, called the “Great Society”, was the domestic agenda of LBJ; however, liberalism has deep roots and drew on a number of sources
    * The liberal belief in the efficacy of government initiatives in addressing social problems can be traced back to the Progressive agenda as well as the New Deal
    * Liberals sided with economist Keynes, who encouraged government expenditures to stimulate economic activity as well as to address broader social and economic goals
    * They sided with moderate labor leaders who had purged the labor movement of Communists and radicals after WWII
    * In terms of foreign policy, liberalism was decidedly anti-Communist
    * Although they condemned the excess of witch-hunting, they attempted to contain international Communism; and while some embraced Communism in the 30s, the violence of Stalinism pushed them toward an anti-Communist position

  * Liberalism in the White House - From Kennedy to Johnson
    * Kennedy’s election was a break with conservatism and an embrace of liberalism
    * His domestic agenda was called the “New Frontier” and are embodied in the Peace Corps, established to assist underdeveloped countries, with their volunteers working for 2 years as teachers, health workers, or advisors
    * He also created the Agency for International Development to coordinate aid to foreign countries, and the Alliance for Progress, a series of development projects in Latin America
    * LBJ passed a host of domestic programs that rivaled the New Deal, however, his administration’s reputation was ruined by a costly and unpopular war in Vietnam

The Great Society Advances the Liberal Agenda

  * The Great Society
    * A major goal of LBJ was to end poverty - Great Society programs developing Medicare and Medicaid, welfare programs, and public housing
    * The Office of Economic Opportunity would oversee these programs, however, they had limited success because the cycle of poverty was too difficult to break in a short period of time
    * The war in Vietnam also became increasingly costly, diverting billions of dollars

Immigrations Reform and the Great Society

  * Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965
    * The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 continued to limit the number of immigrants, but it eliminated the quota system based on national origins
    * Exemptions were set for those who had family members already in the US, and preference was also given to immigrants with particular skills needed in the US

  * “Bull” Connor and the Birmingham Campaign (1963)
    * MLK and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference launched a major campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, to protest racial segregation
    * This was a turning point in the push for federal legislation - public safety commissioner Eugene “Bull” Connor used violent tactics to break up the children’s march

Debate Within the Civil Rights Movement

  * From “Freedom Now!” to “Black Power!”
    * As the civil rights movement achieved success in ending legal segregation, there were still patterns of segregation enforced by custom, as well as the poverty, poor housing, and lack of decent jobs that continued to plague black communities
    * The call switched from Freedom Now! to Black Power!
    * A group known as the Black Panther Party took up this cry but their actions grew increasingly more militant

  * Malcolm X
    * He was a central figure in the more militant turn the civil rights movement took
    * He was a member and leader of the Nation of Islam, an African-American group that shared certain practices with Islam, and advocated that blacks organize among themselves, separate from whites

    * In Engel v. Vitale (1962), SCOTUS ruled that the Regents’ Prayer, a prayer recited by public school children in NY state, was unconstitutional because it violated separation of church and state

===== The Civil Rights Movement Expands =====

Latinos, American Indians, and Asian Americans, Press For Justice

  * American Indians Resistance to Termination
    * American Indians grew increasingly bitter toward federal policies in regard to tribes - in 1953, the government passed a policy of termination, where the government would encourage Indians to assimilate into white culture and would then terminate recognition of tribes as legal entities
    * This weakened the influence of tribal authorities and oled to resistance, and although Eisenhower moved away from an active enforcement of the policy, in 1961 several tribes met and wrote a manifesto called the Declaration of Indian Purpose

    * They adopted a guiding manifesto - the Port Huron Statement - which was an important document in the development of the New Left, stressing participatory democracy and direct action

  * New Left vs. Old Left
    * Old left focused more on workplace issues while the New Left focused on participatory democracy and cultural, social, economic, and political issues
    * The Old Left was closely associated with the Communist Party but both embraced the struggle for black civil rights

Countercultural Values and American Culture

  * Bob Dylan and the Folk Revival
    * His music attracted listeners who found the pop songs of the era repetitive
    * Some of his songs became protest anthems, and his wide-ranging poetic lyrics earned him the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature

  * The British Invasion
    * The Beatles and the Rolling Stones transformed American culture, drawing from African American music - from rhythm and blues to rock ‘n roll
    * Conservatives were troubled by the Beatlemania and their long hair, allusions to drug use, interest in Eastern religions, and challenges to traditional notions of moral values

  * The “Hippie Movement” and Haight-Ashbury
    * This movement was visible in neighborhoods like San Fran.’s Haight-Ashbury and NY’s Greenwich Village
    * This counterculture was a complete rejection of materialistic conformity
    * Encouraged urban and rural communal living, DIY, mystic spiritual experiences, drug use, experimental music, and avant-garde art
    * They organized “be-ins” - gatherings of young people that were part political protest and part Spiritual and artistic festival

  * Woodstock and Altamont
    * Counterculture reached its peak in 1969
    * The Woodstock Festival attracted ½ million attendees to a farm in upstate NY, providing a glimpse of a utopian future
    * Promoters tried to duplicate this at the Altamont Speedway in CA, however, one concertgoer was stopped and stabbed to death by a member of the concert’s security detail as the Rolling Stones performed

===== The Environment and Natural Resources from 1968 to 1980 =====

The Middle East, Oil, and National Energy Policy

  * The US, Israel, and the Arab World
    * Since the founding of Israel in 1948, tensions have existed in the Middle East, with Arab nations refusing to recognize Israel’s right to exist; the US was a strong ally of Israel
    * In 1973, OPEC cut off exports to the US and increased the price of oil, retaliating for US support of Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War

  * The Camp David Accords (1978)
    * Jimmy Carter provided a foundation for a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel
    * These accords are one of the few triumphs for Carter’s presidency
    * In 1977, the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat broke with the other leaders of the Arab world and met Israeli prime minister Meachem Begin
    * They were invited by Carter to a presidential retreat in Maryland, and a peace treaty emerged between Egypt and Israel; tensions still remained between Israel and other nations

  * The Energy Crisis and the Limits of Growth
    * Because of the OPEC oil embargo, America was forced to confront the reality that there were limited fossil fuels, and that most of it came from the Middle East
    * Until the 1970s, Americans assumed petroleum was a cheap, inexhaustible commodity, but the 70s saw a dramatic spike in prices at gas pumps

  * The Iranian Revolution and the Iran Hostage Crisis
    * The 1979, the US supported leader of Iran, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi was ousted by Muslim religious leader, the Ayatollah Khomeini
    * When the US admitted the Shah to the US for medical treatment, angry Iranian students took over the US embassy and kept the personnel there hostage

  * The Carter Doctrine
    * This stated that the US would repel any outside force that attempted to gain control of the Persian Gulf region
    * This would keep an eye on protecting oil interests as well as halting any steps by the USSR on expanding into this region
    * This more aggressive stance in the Middle East was brought about by the Iranian Revolution (1979) and Soviet intervention of Afghanistan
    * The USSR sent troops into Afghanistan to prop up a pro-Soviet government in the face of a rebellion led by the Afghani Mujahideen rebel group
    * The USSR initiated a coup, installed a new government, and remained in the country for a decade
    * Carter saw this as a threat to American interests in the region

  * Toward a National Energy Policy
    * While some were looking for alternative ways the US could access petroleum, others were looking for ways to reduce energy consumption
    * Starting in the 1950s, the US increased its reliance on nuclear power, and Carter with the Department of Energy encouraged conservation measures, such as turning down thermostats and turning off lights
    * He also encouraged investment in renewable energy
    * Americans were very opposed to adopting conservation measures, however

  * The 55 Miles Per Hour Speed Limit and the Truckers’ Rebellion
    * In response to the energy crisis, Nixon proposed a reduced national speed limit, which was passed by Congress as the National Maximum Speed Law in 1974
    * The law was unpopular with many drivers as coupled with rising fuel prices, truckers were especially affected
    * A widespread truckers’ strike would occur in 1974 organized by makeshift groups such as the Owner-Operator and Independent Drivers Association of America, using citizen band radios
    * Despite these efforts, the speed limit stayed in place until the 1980s

  * Nuclear Energy
    * Some Americans put faith in nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels
    * Although uranium did not produce emissions and was cheap, the nuclear waste was hard to dispose of and there was always the risk of accidents like Three Mile Island happening
    * Moreover, nuclear power did not achieve the level of energy generation that planners had hoped for

Growth of the Environmental Movement

  * The Environmental Movement
    * Environmental issues were brought to the public attention by Carson’s 1962 Silent Spring which described how modern society was poisoning the Earth
    * Many participants in the movement were veterans of the New Left and the movement to end the Vietnam War - New Left = critique of corporate power and influence
    * The counterculture hippie movement also encouraged people to rid themselves of material possessions
    * The Nixon administration created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and approved the Clean Air Act to set standards for air quality

  * Love Canal and the Establishment of the Superfund
    * Calls for greater federal environmental regulation of the environment emerged after evidence of deadly toxic pollutants appeared at Love Canal, a waterway near Niagara Falls
    * Residents noticed unusually high levels of birth defects and miscarriages in the area
    * Carter declared a state of emergency, which led to the creation of the federal Superfund program to investigate and clean up contaminated sites

  * The Dangers of Nuclear Energy and Three Mile Island
    * Groups such as the Clamshell Alliance and the Abalone Alliance attracted thousands, gaining strength after a partial meltdown cased a release of radiation at Three Mile Island in 1979
    * In 1986, an explosion led to the release of large amounts of radiation in Chernobyl
    * More recently, in 2011, an earthquake and a tsunami led to the meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan

===== Society in Transition =====

The Conservative Response to Rapid Social and Economic Change

  * The Origins of the Conservative Movement
    * It came of age with the victory of Reagan in 1980, however, it is visible in the 60s as well, with many Americans dismayed by protests against Vietnam, counterculture, civil rights movement, and the changing nature of the American family and the rise in divorce rates
    * The conservative movement can be split in two: a “massive resistance” movement in the South, the John Birch Society, and the 1968 candidacy of Geroge Wallace for president; and a more mainstream conservatism, evident in National Review, edited by Buckley and the candidacy of Barry Goldwater in 1964

  * Young Americans for Freedom
    * Founded by Conservatives in 1960s, its founding document, the Sharon Statement, brought together a correlation between free markets and personal freedom, an emphasis on anti-Communism, and a push toward limiting the size and scope of government

  * Barry Goldwater and the Origins of the New Right
    * Despite losing the LBJ, there was a great deal of grassroots enthusiasm behind Goldwater’s campaign, representing the beginning of modern conservatism

The Decline of Public Trust in the 1970s

  * Stagflation
    * While high unemployment is a sign of a stagnant economy and high inflation is a sign of an active economy, the 1970s experienced high levels of both, dubbed stagflation, continuing throughout the 70s

  * Whip Inflation Now
    * Ford’s solutions were mostly inadequate, his most public initiative being the Whip Inflation Now campaign (WIN), encouraging people to be more disciplined with their money and to wear WIN buttons

  * Foreign Policy Failures of the 1970s
    * Although successful in pursuing peace in the Middle East, his foreign policy results were mixed when it came to the Panama Canal Zone and the Iran hostage crisis
    * Republicans would assert that Carter had left the US in a weaker position

  * The Panama Canal
    * The Panama Canal Treaty called for the US to turn over control of the canal to Panama by December 31, 1999; and the other asserted that the canal shall remain neutral and open to shipping of all nations, reserving the right of the US to intervene if this was not the case
    * Critics were furious that the US surrendered direct control of a major strategic asset

Clashing Political Values

  * Watergate, the Undoing of President Nixon, and the Limits of Presidential Power
    * The Watergate scandal began in 1972 when five men were caught breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic Party at the Watergate hotel in DC
    * Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward of the Washington Post would reveal Nixon’s role in stealing documents and wiretapping the phones of his political rivals; for his reelection campaign
    * In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of articles of impeachment against Nixon, however, before the House of Representatives could address the article,s, Nixon resigned

  * Clashes over Equal Rights
    * There was a push to add an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, galvanizing the women’s liberation movement
    * However, there was conservative backlash, arguing that it would destroy the traditional American family unit
    * The amendment was approved by both House and Senate, but failed to get states’ ratification

  * Clashing Views of Affirmative Action
    * In 1961, Kennedy issued an executive order mandating that projects using federal funds take “affirmative action” to make sure that employers do not discriminate based on race
    * In 1965, LBJ went further, mandating that federal contractors and subcontractors make efforts to hire “protected class, underutilized” candidates
    * When it came to affirmative action, white applicants felt that they were being punished for wrongs done by others; Bakke was denied admission at UCC Medicine
    * In Bakke v. University of California (1978), SCOTUS ruled that the specific quotas for minorities violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, however, they asserted that race could be a factor in admissions decisions

  * Christian Fundamentalism and the Religious Right
    * Opposition to Roe v. Wade
      * Brought together Protestants and Catholics to create a broad Chistian conservative movement
    * The “Moral Majority” and Focus on the Family
      * The Moral Majority was founded by Reverend Jerry Falwell in 1979, who embarked on a series of I Love America rallies, breaking a traditional Baptist principle of separating religion from politics
      * Focus on the Family was founded in 1977 by psychologist James Dobson, and promotes an abstinence only approach to sex education, the reintroduction of prayer into schools, reinforcement of traditional gender roles, and opposition to LGBTQ+ marriage

===== Subject to Debate =====

  * Assessing American and Soviet Actions in the Cold War
    * During the Cold War, historians evaluated American actions as standing for democracy, freedom, and progress while the USSR stood for repression and coercion
    * Now, some actions by the US such as the 1954 coup in Iraq that installed the Shah complicate the picture; and when considering the attacks on Russia that had come through Eastern Europe, their moves become less reprehensible

  * Evaluating American Communism
    * Historians used to believe that the Communist Party as victims of an irrational witch hunt
    * However, damning evidence has been found against the Communist Party, such as evidence that implicates the Rosenbergs as being genuine spies, forcing a reevaluation of the assumption that Communists were innocent victims

  * Avoiding Reductionism - 1920s and 1950s
    * There is a tendency to reduce decades to a single image, however, they are more complex than a single image
    * The 1920s, characterized by “The Roaring Twenties”, with The Great Gatsby, martinis, flappers, and speakeasies; but there were still KKK rallies
    * The 1950s, characterized by conformity and bland TV programs, also had the civil rights movement, the birth of the beat movement, popularity of rock ‘n roll, and folk music revival

  * The Civil Rights Movement: Top Down or Grassroots?
    * Historians who favor a traditional top down interpretation elevate the importance of powerful institutions - the courts, police, officials - in shaping events
    * Some New Left historians focus on the agency of ordinary people - ex. the Birmingham civil rights campaign that prompted Kennedy and Johnson to take action and push for the 1964 Civil Rights Act

  * The Nature of the Vietnam War
    * Some believe the Vietnam war as a struggle by the indigenous Vietcong and its peasant supporters against an oppressive regime while others believe it was North Vietnam and China fomenting chaos in South Vietnam; the role of US intervention is dependent wholly on perspective
    * Some believe that the war was unwinnable while others believe that the war was winnable and Nixon abandoned the fight at the wrong moment

  * Debating Nixon
    * Although Watergate overshadows some of his accomplishments, he still promoted detente with China and the USSR and avoided social and religious issues that characterized subsequent Republican administrations
    * Others insist that his legacy is ruined by the bombing of civilians in Southeast Asia

===== Period 9 =====

===== Reagan, Conservatism, and Partisan Divisions =====

The Ascendancy of the New Right

  * Anatomy of the New Right
    * The conservative movement had three distinct tendencies
      * Cold War conservatives: focused on containing or rolling back communist regimes abroad
      * Pro-business economic conservatives: argue for lower corporate taxes, deregulation, and an economic atmosphere friendly to big business (laissez faire in terms of environmental regulations but willing to use the power of government to further their interests, aka. extend military contracts to large corporations)
      * Religious and cultural wing: grassroots support = victory for Reagan (twice), HW Bush (once), and W Bush (twice) → gained steam as tradition-minded people grew frustrated with counterculture (women’s liberation, gay liberation, assertiveness of African Americans, and illegal drug use)
    * The New Right and the Election of Ronald Reagan
      * A New Deal Democrat, anti-communist, and governor of California (1967-75), his victory can be attributed to immediate causes
      * Carter was seen as ineffective by not securing the quick release of hostages held at the American embassy in Tehran, but Reagan projected hope and optimism for the US
      * His presidency saw tremendous military growth and the end for the USSR and the Communist Bloc which could not match US arms spending; he also gave voice to the New Right movement
    * Reaganomics
      * Similar to Hoover’s approach to the Great Depression, he supported economic policies that favored big business
      * Believed in supply-side economics: stimulating the supply side of the economy - manufacturers, banks, insurance corporations in hopes that this would lead to general economic growth
      * Demand-side economics would argue for increased wages and the expansion of welfare and unemployment benefits
      * Reagan cut taxes for corporations and reduced regulations on industry, arguing for increased deregulation - he came under criticism for weakening much of the environmental legislation of the 70s
    * Contract with America (1994)
      * In 1994, Republicans gained control of the House and Senate - they had not had control of the House since 1954
      * House Republicans signed and issued “Contract with America” weeks before the 1994 election - it was a call to arms for Republicans and called for tougher anti-crime measures, tort reform, and welfare reform
      * Many died in the Senate, some were vetoed by Clinton, some implemented, and some reworked
    * The Impeachment of President Clinton
      * Clinton was accused of having an affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, denying accusations before a federal grand jury
      * When he later admitted to the affair, Republicans accused him of lying to a grand jury and obstruction of justice
      * Clinton was impeached by the House, but found not guilty by the Senate, reflecting the tense relationship between the two major political parties
    * The Election of 2000
      * The voting in Florida was split almost evenly between Al Gore and Bush, and without Florida, neither candidate had 270 electoral votes
      * SCOTUS reversed Florida’s decision to do a hand recount of several counties, breaking with its tendency to assert the power of states within the federal system
      * Bush v. Gore ended the dispute with Bush slightly ahead of Gore, securing Bush’s presidency
    * The Presidency of George W. Bush
      * A major victory for the New Right, he ushered the country through the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but by the end of Bush’s second term, public approval of his presidency was at a historic low, hampering chances of the Republicans to hold onto the White House
    * No Child Left Behind
      * It mandated that states set learning standards, students attain proficiency in reading and math by 2014, and that teachers be highly qualified in the subject area
      * This allowed the state to take over schools and districts that did no meet new guidelines, but it was criticized for its lack of funding to reach these goals, and many educators questioned the increased reliance on standardized tests

The Deepening of Partisanship in the 21st Century

  * The Election of President Barack Obama (2008)
    * This was a milestone for the civil rights movement, and his victory was the result of a series of factors
    * The Obama campaign was able to harness the power of the Internet, as well as Obama’s charisma, to build a large base

  * The Rise of the Tea Party Movement
    * Heavily promoted by Fox, the election of Obama generated a vocal opposition movement known as the Tea Party (referring to American action against British tyranny)
    * This represented a grassroots sense of discontent with big government; however, this movement often exhibited hyperbolic language, predicting the onset of tyranny, fascism, and Communism

  * The Election of Donald Trump (2016)
    * His blunt style of speaking was appealing, perceived as speaking his mind, unencumbered by political correctness
    * Days before the elections, the FBI reopened its investigations of Clinton’s emails; and accusations were made that the Russian government interfered with the 2016 election on behalf of Trump
    * Nevertheless, he won the majority of votes in the electoral college, however, he did not win the popular vote

  * The Presidency of Donald Trump
    * His initial attempts to undo the Affordable Care Act failed to win congressional support and set a travel ban on Muslim countries
    * The Trump administration’s first major victory was a major overhaul of the tax code, with major cuts in corporate taxes and significant reductions in the tax rates of the wealthy
    * He also rolled back environmental regulations put in place during the Obama administration, and undid regulations in the financial industry

  * The Impeachment of President Trump
    * In 2019, the House passed articles of impeachment against Trump, accusing him from putting his personal political interest above the country, abused the powers of the presidency by enlisting Ukraine to get dirt on Biden
    * He was also accused of obstruction of Congress, asserting that Trump violated the House’s sole Power of Impeachment by directing the defiance of subpoenas and seeking to control the impeachment process
    * The Senate declared him not guilty however

Reducing Big Government: Rhetoric and Reality

  * The Expansion of Medicare and Medicaid
    * Medicare provides health insurance to those over 65 and those with disabilities
    * Medicaid is a government insurance program for low-income people
    * As people live longer, the costs to the Medicare program increase
    * In the 1980s, Reagan led the effort to pass a Social Security reform bill designed to ensure the long-term solvency of the program

  * Growth of the Federal Deficit
    * By cutting corporate taxes and taxes on the wealthy, Reagan was cutting government revenues, however, he increased spending on armaments
    * This led to a doubling of the national debt - hindering economic growth to some degree since and forced careful considerations of American debt for future administrations

Debates over the Scope of Government and International Trade

  * NAFTA and the Push Toward Free Trade
    * Clinton broke with organized labor and environmental groups by embracing NAFTA, eliminating all trade barriers and tariffs among the US, Canada, and Mexico
    * This generated controversy as free-trade supporters promised global prosperity as more nations participated in the global economy, however, opponents argued that nations would no longer be able to implement environmental regulations, ensure workers’ rights, or protect fledgling industries from foreign competition

  * The General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT)
    * It was an international trade agreement that sought to encourage countries to participate in the global economy by reducing barriers to trade
    * Issues of globalization and free trade have inspired protests - some believe that these agreements have caused the decline of industrial jobs in the midwest while others cite the ready availability of inexpensive consumer products as evidence of the success of the free-trade ethos

  * Challenges to Globalization
    * Labor organizations argue that eliminating trade barriers will lead to loss of American jobs as businesses gravitate toward cheap labor, and environmentalists worry that free-trade treaties will prevent participating countries from enacting strong environmental protections
    * These opponents came together in Seattle to protest at a meeting of the World Trade Organization

  * Changes in the Welfare System
    * Clinton adopted one of the planks of “Contract with America” in 1996 by ending welfare as a federal program and shifting its administration to the state level, shocking many liberal Democrats
    * They had pushed for federal entitlement programs since the New Deal, however, Clinton perceived that many Americans were growing tired of programs that did not seem to reduce poverty

  * Toward Healthcare Reform
    * Clinton put forth the idea of a federal health insurance plan that would provide subsidized insurance to many of the 39 million uncovered Americans and would bring down health insurance costs for everyone
    * This was vigorously opposed by the pharmaceutical and insurance industries and was ultimately shot down by a Republican filibuster

  * Debates over Social Security Reform
    * Many worry that when the baby boomers become senior citizens, Medicare and Social Security will be unable to stay financially solvent
    * Republicans pushed for privatization of the system whereas Democrats pushed for increased funding streams to ensure future viability

  * Reform of the Financial Sector
    * Republicans argue for deregulation of major industries, including financial firms, and resist calls for increased government oversight
    * They argue that excessive regulation impede risk-taking, competition, and economic growth
    * Democrats argue that regulation is necessary to check reckless behavior on the part of the financial industry and to protect the economy from rapid fluctuations

  * The Savings and Loan Crisis and Bailout
    * In the 80s, the nation’s savings and loan associations suffered from a spate of irresponsible and risky investments and a downturn in the housing market
    * Their situation was made worse by deregulation of the industry, and legislation widened their investment options, paving the way for riskier investments
    * By 1989, more than 700 S&Ls had become insolvent, and HW Bush signed a bailout bill that extended billions of dollars to the industry
    * Some economists believe that the bailout created a moral hazard, in which people are more willing to take risks, seeing a connection between between this and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007

  * The Housing Crisis and the Great Recession
    * This led to high unemployment, falling wages, and a housing crisis characterized by widespread foreclosures
    * Many see the crisis in the housing market as an important cause of the Great Recession - in the 2000s, lending institutions devised new methods of borrowing money after the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, removing regulatory constraints on the banking industry
    * Banks lured first time home buyers to take out mortgages for home purchases that were beyond their means and to people whose ability to repay and whose credit rating were less than prime
    * These lenders would sell these mortgages to Wall Street, and Wall Street would bundle these mortgages into stock offerings, and many funds invested in these offerings
    * In 2007, this bubble burst as the real-estate market weakened and interest rates increased → many subprime borrowers found themselves underwater - the market value of their homes sank below the amount they owed on their mortgages
    * Their only option was to walk away from their homes, leading to widespread foreclosures
    * Major financial institutions that had invested in risky mortgages found themselves in desperate straits, major banks cut back on lending money, business activity slowed, and consumer spending was drastically reduced

  * Government Responses to the Great Recession
    * The W Bush administration and the Federal Reserve Bank took a number of steps to address the economic crisis and prevent a collapse of major economic institutions
    * The Fed outlined a loan program for the country’s largest banks to borrow Treasury securities at discounted rates
    * The Troubled Asset Relief Program was created to strengthen the financial sector and restore confidence in the securities market
    * Critics claimed that the government did not tie this money to any guidelines to ensure this money would be used for recovery

  * Bailout of the Automobile Industry
    * The automobile industry also went into financial crisis in 2008, partly as a result of reduced consumer spending and a result of rising fuel prices
    * Bush agreed to lend $17.4 billion to GM and Chrysler to keep them afloat, and Obama continued to extend those loans
    * The bailout was successful; the automobile industry recovered and paid back $71 billion of the $82 billion used in the bailout

  * The Stimulus Package
    * Obama addressed the Great Recession with a major stimulus bill - the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009)
    * This provided $800 billion to state and local governments to be used for infrastructure, projects, schools, and hospitals
    * This reflected Keynes, who wrote The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, arguing that during times of recession, the government should increase spending
    * Unemployment went down during Obama’s time in office, however, it is not clear how much of that was because of the stimulus package and how much of it was due to a generally improving economy

  * The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
    * Designed to regulate financial markets and protect consumers
    * It established the Financial Services Oversight Council to examine new and risky practices by large corporations
    * It was designed in part to end the concept of too big to fail, to avert having a company whose failure would have devastating consequences on the economy, and to stop these companies from having a reliance on the government bailout
    * After the election of Trump, congressional Republicans began pushing to roll back many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act

  * President Obama and Health Care Reform
    * This was one of his first major domestic initiatives
    * The Patient Protection and Affordable Care was challenged in several federal courts - 3 upheld it and 2 deemed parts of it unconstitutional
    * In 2012, SCOTUS upheld the constitutionality of the act’s individual mandate as an exercise of Congress’s taxing power
    * The act has generated opposition from Republicans, even as more Americans have begun participating in Obamacare

  * Impact of the Affordable Care Act
    * This dramatically reduced the number of uninsured Amerians, providing insurance to 24 million, driving the uninsured rate from 16 in 2010 to 8.9 in 2016
    * At the same time, premium costs for some increased, especially for those upper class who do not receive federal subsidies for their insurance plans, and because there was less choice of insurance providers because some pulled out of certain marketplaces

Debates Around Identity and Social Issues

  * Redefining Family Structures
    * Growth of nontraditional families - non-married households rose from 26% in 1972 to 47% in 1998
    * Liberals have called for measures to extend rights and services to such households, and conservatives have called for a return to traditional family values

  * Women in Professions
    * The quiet revolution of women entering the workplace in larger numbers continued
    * The push for government-funded day care and for greater participation by men in child-rearing led to advances, however, women still earn less on average than men

  * Activism by Women in the Trump Era
    * Following Trump’s inauguration, the Women’s March on Washington drew between 3 and 5 million participants
    * The women’s rights movement also called attention to sexual harassment and assault through the #MeToo Movement, shedding light on workplace dynamics and empowered women to break the silence around these issues
    * The movement gained prominence in the aftermath of accusations of sexual abuse by movie producer Harvey Weinstein

  * The Gay Rights Movement and Changing Public Perceptions
    * This grew in intensity after the Stonewall riots of 1969, and with strong conservative backlash against gay rights, this has shaped debates around LGBTQ rights

  * The AIDS Crisis
    * In 1981, there was a mysterious disease that seemed to disproportionately affect gay men called AIDS - the cause of which was HIV
    * It was not until 1987 that the NIH established a committee to research the impact of HIV
    * AIDS swept through gay communities - many Christian fundamentalists saw AIDS as God’s punishment as God’s punishment for sinful behavior
    * On the other hand, the crisis galvanized the gay community, and staged protests for more resources to be devoted to AIDS research and treatment

  * Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell
    * This was a policy adopted by the military in 1994 that allowed LGBTQ members to serve as long as they remained closetted - this was protested by the LGTBQ community on the grounds of discrimination and limiting freedom of speech and expression
    * It was repealed by Congress and signed by Obama in 2011

  * Same-Sex Marriage
    * In 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court in Baehr v. Lewin ruled that the state ban on same-sex marriage was discriminatory, which led to opposition by conservatives
    * Conservatives passed an amendment allowing the Hawaii state legislature to ban same-sex marriage, and many states followed
    * Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 which allowed states to not recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states
    * The tide turned in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the state may not forbid same-sex couples from legally marrying - several other state courts followed
    * In 2013, in United States v. Windsor, a section of DOMA that defined marriage as between a man and woman was struck down
    * By 2015, SCOTUS ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that marriage is a fundamental right that must be guaranteed to same-sex couples

  * Race and Economics in the Post-Civil Rights Era
    * On one hand, opportunities in housing and employment opened up, and high school graduation rates as well as college have both increased
    * On the other hand, poverty continues to be an issue for many African-Americans - a declining industrial sector and reductions in government services have hit this segment of the black community hard
    * A study in 2018 found that 22% of blacks were living in poverty whereas only 13% of all Americans were - blacks in poverty are much more likely to live in neighborhoods with overall high poverty rates

  * Policing, Incarceration, and Race
    * In 1965, LBJ urged Congress to engage in an effective war against crime, Nixon’s tough on crime policies further criminalized the possession and use of illegal drugs, and the drug war was a major goal of Reagan
    * The Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986) took a punitive stance towards drugs and enacted new mandatory minimum sentences for drugs
    * The 1994 anti-crime bill signed by Clinton is seen by many as contributing to the increase in prison population
    * Blacks are incarcerated at more than 5x the rate of whites and comprise over 35% of people in correctional facilities
    * Under Obama, the Justice Department found longtime patterns of discrimination and violations of constitutional protections in Ferguson (where an unarmed black 18 year old Brown was shot)
    * BLM emerged in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Zimmerman, a Florida man who shot Martin, a black teenager
    * BLM also because associated with street protests against police shoots, racial profiling, police brutality, and racial and economic inequality

  * The Debate Around Gun Violence and Gun Control
    * Shootings in Sandy Hook left 27 dead in 2012; 2017 - Las Vegas - 58 dead, 413 wounded; 2018 - Parkland - 17 dead, 17 injured
    * Congress failed to pass bills banning assault weapons and calling for expanded background checks for gun purchases
    * The NRA has lobbied against any type of gun control, citing the importance of the Second Amendment

===== The End of the Cold War =====

The United States and the World During the Reagan Administration

  * Soviet-American Relations from Detente to Confrontation
    * Relations between the US and USSR, which had been improving since Nixon’s attempts at detente, soured after the USSR invaded Afghanistan (1979)
    * Carter suspended grain sales to the USSR and pushed for a US boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow
    * Reagan denounced the USSR using pointedly ideological language, labeling them an evil empire

  * Increased Military Spending
    * He vowed to close “a window of vulnerability” - the ability of Soviet missiles to strike before the US could respond, beginning the Strategic Defense Initiative - dubbed Star Wars by critics - and initiated the costly MX missile program

  * The Reagan Doctrine
    * Reagan’s administration supported governments that were anti-Communist, even if they were undemocratic or repressive, sending troops to Grenada in 1983 to topple to Marxist leaders of the country, and supporting the dictatorial regime of the Philippines led by Marcos, despite reports of electoral fraud

  * Central American and the Iran-Contra Scandal
    * Reagan tried to undermine the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua who took power in 1979 after overthrowing the US backed dictatorship of Somoza
    * The US funded and trained a military group known as the Contras, but Congress, in 1982, alarmed at reports of human rights abuses by the Contras, passed the Boland Amendment to halt US aid to the group
    * However, an elaborate scheme was developed to secretly sell weapons to Iran and use funds from these sales to support the Contras
    * Details of this affair became public in 1986, and 14 members of the Reagan administration were tried for violating US law - Reagan claimed to have had no direct knowledge of the program
    * Critics labeled him the Teflon president because accusations of wrongdoing did not stick to him

The Fall of the Soviet Union and the Collapse of Communism

  * The Fall of the Berlin Wall and the End of the Cold War
    * In the 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev began to enact a series of political and economic reforms in the USSR, in many ways, these reforms opened the way for protests and challenges that ultimately undid Soviet Communism
    * He introduced glasnost, a dismantling of the repressive apparatus of the USSR, and perestroika, the introduction of elements of capitalism to the sluggish Soviet economy
    * Mass public protests had begun to weaken the governments in Poland and East Germany, especially when it was clear that Gorbachev would not intervene militarily to halt this development
    * By the end of 1989, everyone Communist government in Europe was either toppled or transformed into a non-Communist regime
    * The tearing of the wall, separating West from East Berlin, was a symbol of the rift between the Communist Bloc and the Western countries
    * By 1991, the Soviet Union had collapsed, ending Communism in Europe

The United States in the Post-Cold War Period

  * President George Bush and the Persian Gulf War
    * HW Bush’s main accomplishments were in foreign affairs - it was during his presidency that the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union collapsed
    * After Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait in 1990 to gain more control over oil, Bush organized a 34 nation coalition to challenge the move
    * When Hussein failed to comply with Bush’s 6 week deadline to withdraw, the coalition initiated Operation Desert Storm, defeating Iraqi forces and driving them from Kuwait
    * During the Persian Gulf War, significant numbers of women served in combat roles for the first time

  * Chaos in Somalia
    * Clinton deployed US forces to aid a UN humanitarian mission in Somalia in 1993 - troubles had begun a year earlier when the government was overthrown and a civil war ensued between competing factions, leading to famine and ½ million deaths
    * Much of the food delivered by the UN to Somalia was stolen by the factions and sold for weapons
    * Bush approved the use of US troops to aid UN relief activities, but the mission ended in a US withdrawal after American forces suffered 19 deaths in Mogadishu

  * Democracy in Haiti
    * Clinton took the lead in ensuring a transition to democracy in Haiti in 1994 after democratically elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted by a Haitian general
    * Former president Carter was dispatched to try to negotiate an end to military rule, and he was successful - Aristide returned to power in 1995

  * Intervention in the Former Yugoslavia
    * Clinton became increasingly concerned about violence in former Yugoslavia - after Communism fell in 1989, the country split into smaller nations
    * Ethnic violence developed as Serbain forces attempted to gain control of areas of Bosnia with large Serbian populations - they would try to remove Bosnians through a campaign of ethnic cleansing
    * As the media reported on Serbian brutality, the US decided to take action, with Clinton bringing leaders from Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia, together in 1995 to sign the Dayton Agreement, with 60,000 NATO troops dispatched to enforce it

  * President Clinton and the Conflict in the Middle East
    * Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel has occupied adjacent lands where Palestinians live, including the West Bank of the Jordan, the Gaza Strip, and Eastern Jerusalem
    * Israel resisted agreeing to the formation of a Palestinian state as long as Palestinians launched attacks on Israel, with the growht of Jewish settlements in teh West Bank complicating matters
    * Clinton invited Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak to Camp David, but the conflict still remains unresolved

===== A Changing Economy =====

The Economy in the Digital Age

  * The Digital Revolution
    * Apple launched a PC in 1977 and IBM followed; in the early 1980s, Microsoft developed operating systems, and through the 1980s, PC became ubiquitous in workplaces

  * Economic Productivity in the Digital Age
    * Economists cite an increase in productivity growth as due to the widespread use of information technologies and the increase in the speed of communications across the globe
    * However, economists have noted that the increase in overall economic productivity has not led to the expected increases in standards of living
    * Some cite the costs of replacing outdated equipment as a countervailing factor, while others cite the changing nature of work and the growing income gap as factors that prevent many ordinary Americans from enjoying the fruits of the digital revolution

New Technologies, New Behaviors

  * The Development and Spread of the Internet
    * The origins of the Internet date from the 1960s as the Department of Defense sought to create a computer system that would allow far-flung military installations to exchange computer information
    * In the late 1980s, universities in the US created a computer network to facilitate the sharing of research while in Switzerland, engineers developed the World Wide Web
    * Internet use grew rapidly in the 1990s and changed the way of life - email rendered letter writing obsolete, file sharing of music and video have forced the entertainment industry to rethink its business model, and traditional news outlets have been forced to compete with the instantaneous information available on the Internet
    * It allowed for virtual business meetings and allowed users to browse merchandise on their personal computers and purchase items without leaving their homes - making shopping easier but also driving many brick and mortar stores out of business
    * Obama’s campaign demonstrated the power of the Internet to build a grassroots network of activists and contributors, and Twitter has served as a primary method for Trump to communicate with the public
    * Critics note that smartphones tend to distract users from tasks such as driving and social interactions in front of them

Economic Shifts: The Decline of Manufacturing and the Rise of the Service Sector

  * The Deindustrialization of America
    * From the 1960s onward, large numbers of factories have closed in cities such as NY, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago
    * Since the 1980s, there has been a rapid shift of the manufacturing sector out of the US and into less-developed parts of this world - a trend accelerated by free-trade agreements
    * The rise of the private manufacturing sector in Communist China has also played a major role - because firms in China are able to produce goods at lower costs, American imports from China grew dramatically in the late 20th and early 21st century

  * Decline of Union Membership
    * In 1954, union membership in the US peaked at 35% while it is currently at 10%
    * A major turning point toward unionized workers came in 1981 under Reagan when he fired air traffic controllers who went on strike - this broke their union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers’ Organization, and was consistent with helping big business
    * Every year, there were fewer strikes and lockouts
    * More recently, states passed right-to-work laws where workers can opt out of paying union dues, even while being represented by the union
    * In addition, unions representing public workers have come under attack in several states, where legislation cut collective bargaining rights and benefits of public employees
    * Median wages and benefits have fallen for teachers in states where this legislation has passed

  * The Growth of the Service Sector
    * It grew significantly from 1980 to present - the primary sector includes the extraction and production of raw materials and the secondary sector is considered manufacturing; the service sector is considered the tertiary sector which involves the production of services rather than end products
    * The service sector includes shipping and trucking, banking services, IT, waste disposal, education, government, healthcare, legal services, and a whole host of retail and food-service operations
    * Currently, 70% of jobs in the US are in the service sector, representing a shift in the economy from the production of things to the providing of services
    * The growth of low wage jobs in the retail and fast-food fields has contributed to the stagnation of wages and to a growing income gap - and efforts to unionize workers in these fields have almost all failed due to anti-union activities by the corporations
    * The goal of a $15 minimum wage has been a rallying cry of this movement

  * The Growth of the “Gig Economy”
    * The growth of the Internet has contributed to the growth of the “Gig Economy”
    * TaskRabbit and Uber are prominent companies - 36% of American workers are involved in the gig economy
    * For some, gig work supplements their current income, others join the gig economy because they cannot find full-time employment
    * Although this may provide flexibility, the gig economy does not provide employee benefits or worker protections, and often results in low pay

Increasing Wealth Inequality

  * The Growth of the Income Gap
    * The incomes for the top earning one percent of households increased by about 275% between 1979 and 2007, while the middle of 60% of wage-earners saw their income rise by just under 40%
    * Many economists cite the disappearance of higher-paying manufacturing jobs and the growth of low-wage service-sector jobs and “gig” work
    * Other factors include the decline of union movement and changes in the tax code, including massive tax cuts initiated by W Bush, and the Great Recession
    * The growth of the gig economy has tended to depress income for workers, and calls for a fundamental restructuring of the economy in order to challenge economic inequality have formed the basis of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the campaigns of Sanders

===== Migration and Immigration, 1980 to Present =====

Immigration and the Growth of the Sun Belt

  * Growth of the Sun Belt
    * The states in the sun belt - CA, TX, AZ, NV, FL - have seen remarkable growth since WWII when defense related industries there attracted large numbers of workers
    * As these states grew, their political power also increased, generally faring well for the Republican Party as conservatives have gained seated in the South and the West whereas liberal states of the Midwest and Northeast lost power in Congress

Asian and Latin American Immigration

  * Post-1965 Immigration Patterns
    * After the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, immigration increased significantly from Asia, Lat. Am., Africa, and the Middle East
    * Currently, immigration accounts for a third of population growth - immigration has been an important factor in the growth of the Southwestern states

  * The Changing Ethnic Makeup of the US
    * It is estimated that by 2042, non-Hispanic whites will no longer constitute a majority of the population of the United States

Immigration Policy

  * Debates Around Immigration
    * Some americans have a more welcoming attitude toward immigration, focusing on its positive social and economic impacts; others fear that large numbers of immigrants (many illegal) will take jobs from Amricans and draw on public resources
    * Republicans have generally sided with anti-immigrant sentiment, arguing for a more secure border with Mexico and passing the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, forcing employers to ensure that their workforce was composed of only legal immigrants

  * Immigration Policy Under President Obama
    * He pushed for comprehensive immigration reform but was met with opposition from Republicans
    * He achieved limited success in 2012 with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protected minors whose parents did not enter legally
    * Although he tried to create pathways to legal status for undocumented immigrants, he also increased the number of deportations

  * Immigration Policy Under President Trump
    * He instituted a ban in 2017 against the entry of 7 Muslin countries into the united states, as well as indefinitely suspending the entry of Syrian refugees
    * This led to many protests and replaced the executive order, which maintained a travel ban but made exceptions for green card and visa holders

===== Defining America’s Role in the World in the 21st Century =====

The Terrorist Attacks of 2001 and the US Response

  * Terrorist Attacks Against the United States
    * 19 terrorists from al-Qaeda hijacked 4 domestic airplanes, crashing into the Pentagon, Pennsylvania, and the World Trade Center in NYC
    * Approximately 3000 people died in total

  * War in Afghanistan
    * The 2001 attacks were followed by W Bush initiating military action in Afghanistan and Iraq
    * American forces overthrew the Taliban, the government that had given refuge to al-Qaeda
    * Even though Obama’s administration was able to kill bin Laden, it was not able to end the war in Afghanistan, and military violence continues today

  * War with Iraq
    * Operation Iraqi Freedom began in 2003; it was the US military campaign to remove President Saddam Hussein from power and create a more democratic government in Iraq
    * Without evidence, W Bush claimed that Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction and that there was connection between Hussein and the 2001 attacks
    * Defeating Hussein and the Iraqi army was an easy task, but creating stability in Iraq was not - attacks by insurgents continued and Operation Iraqi Freedom hurt Bush’s approval ratings and created tensions between the US and some European nations

Liberty, Security, and Human Rights in the War on Terrorism

  * The Patriot Act
    * It greatly expanded the government’s authority in the fight against terrorism
    * Many criticized the use of National Security Letters, which allow the FBI to search telephone, email, and financial records without a court order

  * Department of Homeland Security
    * The creation of this department was a result of the 2001 attacks, responsible for protecting the US from terrorist attacks and natural disasters

  * Tactics in the War on Terrorism
    * The release of photographs of US army personnel abusing prisoners at a prison in Iraq cast light on the US handling of prisoners
    * Army personnel were given permission to use “enhanced interrogation” techniques, including waterboarding and torture
    * In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), ruled that the Bush administration could not hold detainees indefinitely without due process
    * Congress passed the Military Commission Act (2006) intended to address concerns, but still allows for the removal of procedural safeguards ordinarily employed in judicial trials

  * President Obama and the War on Terrorism
    * Concerns about the way the war on terrorism was being carried out under Bush helped elevate Obama over McCain
    * Although Obama carried out the killing of bin Laden, he continued many of the controversial antiterrorism policies begun in the Bush administration, and had not closed down the prison at Guantanamo Bay

Energy Policy, Consumption, and the Limits to Growth

  * Climate Change and Energy Policy
    * After the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and the energy crisis that followed the 1979 Iranian Revolution, American policymakers began to look for ways for the US to reduce its consumption of energy, which has been augmented by concerns over climate change
    * More recently, the US played an important role in the Paris Agreement, however, Trump ended the USA's participation in it
    * Communities are passing legislation to reduce gas emissions, encouraging bicycling and mass transit
    * However, many critics are saying that these steps are not enough to stop climate change

United States Foreign Policy in the 21st Century

  * President George W. Bush and the Withdrawal from the International Community
    * Bush distrusted many of the multilateral entities in which the US had participated, withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement on environmental goals, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so that the US could develop a space-based missile-defense system, and the UN’s International Criminal Court

  * The Bush Doctrine
    * He put forth a more aggressive approach in the fall of 2002 that called for pre-emptive strikes against nations perceived as threat to the US
    * Bush identified an axis of evil consisting of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea
    * This reliance on preemptive warfare is known as the Bush Doctrine

  * President Obama and the Middle East
    * He was eager to initiate a “new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest” with the Muslim world
    * Obama spoke favorably about the Arab Spring protests which spoke out against oppressive regimes and low living standards
    * However, most authoritarian regimes reasserted power in the Arab Winter

  * The Iran Nuclear Deal
    * Obama prioritized preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons - negotiations between the US and Iran entitled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (2015): removing sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran’s promise not to produce a nuclear bomb
    * This deal was seen as an opportunity to making the world a safer place, but was condemned by Republicans and Israeli prime minister Netanyahu
    * In 2018, Trump removed the US from the deal and in 2020, the US killed Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani

  * Tensions with Russia
    * Putin was opposed to the Iraq War and the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe, seeing both events as an expansion of American and Western influence
    * Russia’s actions against neighboring countries have led to criticism and increased tensions with the US
    * Relations soured again in 2012 when Russia supported Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian Civil War despite his brutal treatment of his opposition
    * In 2014, Putin occupied Crimea with Russian troops, which was seen as illegal by the US, and Obama imposed sanctions on several wealthy advisors close to Putin
    * The Mueller report noted eleven episodes of possible obstruction of justice on the part of Trump and Russia’s attempt to interfere in the election on behalf of him

  * Normalizing Relations with Cuba
    * Obama announced in 2015 that the US and Cuba would resume diplomatic relations and that the United States would open an embassy in Havana
    * Trump suspended the Obama-era policy of granting Cuba relief from sanctions, but he did not rescind diplomatic relations between the two countries

===== Subject to Debate =====

  * The Legacy of President Ronald Reagan
    * On one side, critics cite rising budget deficits, an increase in homelessness along with cuts to social services, an increase in the wealth gap resulting from tax cuts, and attack on unionized workers as characterizing Reagan’s presidency
    * His defenders focus on his initiation of a massive military buildup that led to the fall of Communism in Europe

  * Causes of the Rise of the New Right
    * The New Right stands for its opposites - conservative approaches to sexuality, respect for authority and discipline, and unifying patriotism

  * Putting the Recent Past into Context
    * One topic that historians begin to wrestle with is the origins of the toxic partisan atmosphere - some look to the impeachment against Clinton as a turning point
    * Historians also note the closeness of each party - each party feels as though victory is in its grasp - proved by the closeness of elections such as Bush v. Gore

**Condensed Review**

Terms:

SCOTUS = Supreme Court of the United States

Roosevelt = Theodore Roosevelt

FDR = Franklin Delano Roosevelt

LBJ = Lyndon B. Johnson

===== Period 1 (Natives and Exploration) =====

===== Native Americans =====

|**Location**|**Economic**|**Social**|
|**Southwest**|Maize, hunting, gathering|The Pueblo Tribes, Navajo, and Apache deserted the area in 1300 CE because of crop failures|
|**West**|Hunting, gathering, fishing - provided goods to trade|Sedentary villages (different villages for different hunting/gathering seasons - they would stay at one and go to another when the season changed)|
|**Northeast**|Three-sister farming: squash, beans, corn|Permanent and large villages in the Ohio River Valley\\ Iroquois League curbed intertribal violence\\ |
|**Southeast**| |Organized urban centers\\ Five Civilized Tribes made alliances with the colonists (Jamestown)\\ |
|**Plains**|Corn, hunting, gathering|Sedentary villages\\ They were the victims of colonists’ westward expansion; native groups forced out of the east settled with Plains natives and led to increased competition\\ |

===== European Interaction =====

|**Causes**|**Effects**|
|• GGG|• Columbian Exchange\\ • Treaty of Tordesillas\\ • Encomienda System → Repartimiento/use of black slaves\\ • Virginia Company and Jamestown\\ |

===== Big Ideas =====

  * Native Americans developed distinct and increasingly complex societies in diverse environments

  * European nations’ efforts for exploration stemmed from GGG

  * The Columbian Exchange brought new crops to Europe from the Americas, stimulating European population growth, and new sources of mineral wealth, which facilitated the European shift from feudalism to capitalism

  * Europeans and Native Americans asserted divergent worldviews in terms of religion, gender roles, family, land use, and power

===== Period 2 (Colonization) =====

===== Differences Between Countries’ Colonies =====

| |**England**|**France**|**Spain**|
|**Economic**|Agriculture|Fur|Gold/Silver|

===== Colonies =====

|**New England**|**Middle**|**Southern**|
|• Puritans and Pilgrims\\ • Rocky soil → subsistence farming\\ • Whaling, fishing, shipbuilding, logging\\ • Bradford - Plymouth\\ • Winthrop - Massachusetts Bay\\ |• Breadbasket (grain, oats)\\ • Fur trade, lumber, shipbuilding\\ • Religious tolerance\\ • William Penn - Pennsylvania (Quakers) = freedom of religion, high immigration\\ |• Indentured servants and slave labor\\ • Rice, indigo, and tobacco\\ • Chattel slavery (slave’s children = slaves)\\ • Jamestown\\ • Lord Baltimore - Maryland\\ • Headright system - 50 acres for paying for indentured servant’s passage\\ |

|**Causes of Slavery**|**Effects of Slavery**|
|Bacon’s Rebellion:\\ • Former indentured servants grew resentful of taxes they had to pay and burned down homes of the elite\\ • Virginians turned to slaves instead of unreliable indentured servants\\ |Stono Rebellion\\ • Led to the deaths of 20 slave owners\\ • Tightened slave codes\\ • Lesser rebellion: working slowly, breaking tools, keeping cultural ties to Africa\\ |

===== Native American Conflict =====

|**Native Attacks**|• 1st Powhatan War: Indian assaults led to the death of 347 colonists\\ • 2nd Powhatan War: Indian attempts to drive the colonists out fail\\ • Susquehannock War: Indians attack colonists → Bacon’s Rebellion\\ |
|**Colonist Attacks**|• King Philip’s War: English encroachment on Indian lands, English cattle destroy cornfields\\ ◦ Half of New England towns destroyed, 1/10 colonists dead\\ |
|**Spanish**|• Pueblo Revolt: Encomienda system disrupted native economy, Pueblo religion was banned → 300+ Spanish died, Spanish were driven out for 12 years|

===== Britain and the Colonies =====

|**Economic**|Mercantilism:\\ - Colonies should benefit the mother country (exports > imports) - so need\\ colony to supply raw materials\\ -\\ Wool, Hat, Iron Act established to prevent the development of manufacturing in the colonies|
|**Religious**|1st Great Awakening:\\ - An\\ emotional manifestation of religion - preachers held large meetings in rural areas (George Whitfield)\\ - Promoted a\\ democratic sense - everyone should have religious experience\\ - Led to weakening of established churches, rejection of overly intellectual clergy,\\ first unifying experience of the colonies|
|**Social**|Trans-Atlantic Print Culture:\\ - Most\\ news that came from Britain appealed to merchants - commodity prices, ship arrivals, European politics\\ - Regulated by public officials: fear of undermining British authority\\ - By 1776, more than 50% of men were literate\\ - Enlightenment = confidence about attacking government in newspaper\\ - Franklin’s almanac\\ |
|**Intellectual**|Enlightenment:\\ - John Locke: people have natural rights, including the\\ right to rebel under a tyrannical government\\ - Montesquieu: separation of powers and\\ checks and balances\\ - Radical Whig Ideology: Whig pamphlets were spread to the US - concentrated power = threat to liberty, balance between legislature and king\\ |

===== Big Ideas =====

  * The goals and patterns of colonization varied among the British, French, Spanish, and Dutch empires

  * The British colonies developed into different regions based on geography, types of settlers, motives for settling, and reliance on slavery

  * European nations had varying types of relations with natives - sometimes allies and sometimes enemies

  * Colonies were connected to Britain, but began drifting away

===== Period 3 (Revolution, America in Infancy) =====

===== Causes of Revolution =====

**Political Cause: French and Indian War**

|**Causes**|- Land disputes in the Ohio River Valley → forts built and skirmishes → French and Indian War|
|**Timeline**|- Local affair - continuation of skirmishes between British and French colonists\\ -\\ Full takeover of the war by Britain, seizing supplies and forcing colonists to join the war - the colonists resisted\\ - British government tried to work with the colonies and reinforced the troops with British soldiers → French surrendered in 1761\\ |
|**Effects**|- Treaty of Paris (1763): France surrendered its North American empire - Canada and east of Mississippi to Britain and West of Mississippi River to Spain\\ -\\ Sugar, Stamp, Quartering Act\\ -\\ Pontiac’s Rebellion: colonists occupied Ottawa land, clash with natives\\ -\\ Proclamation Act of 1763: Britain ordered colonists not to settle beyond the Appalachians; many colonists had already migrated because they believed they deserved the land for the sacrifices they made in the war|

**Economic Causes: Acts**

|**Incident**|**Reaction**|
|**Stamp Act**|• Stamp Act Congress: delegates wrote a list of grievances: No taxation without representation\\ • Committees of Correspondence: shadow governments that worked to undermine royal governors\\ • Sons of Liberty harassed Stamp Act agents, stores were ransacked if they did not boycott British goods\\ |
|**Townshend Act**: Taxed imported goods|• Called for boycotts, Americans sought locally produced goods\\ • Boston Massacre: Britain deployed troops to quell riots, when heckled, they shot Bostonians\\ |
|**Tea Act**: allowed British East India Company monopoly|• Boston Tea Party: dumped $2 million of tea in the harbor to protest|
|**Intolerable Acts**: Put MA under British rule, closed Boston’s ports, expanded the Quartering Act, can move trials from MA to Britain|• Continental Congress: passed resolutions on nonimportation, nonexportation, and nonconsumption to cut off all trade with Britain\\ • Committees of Safety: enforced the agreements and recommended military preparations\\ |

**Intellectual Causes**

|**Protestant Evangelicalism**|Focused on individual conversion, ministers projected the American Revolution as a struggle against godless tyranny|
|**Enlightenment**|Ideas of Locke and Montesquieu|
|**Common Sense**|Argued that independence was the only path for the colonies|
|**Declaration of Independence**|Most colonists at the beginning of the war did not want full independence; the Declaration listed grievances and formally declared independence from Britain, after being passed by the Continental Congress|

===== Revolution =====

|**Britain’s Advantages**|**Colonies’ Advantages**|
|• Highly trained, professional army\\ • Strongest navy\\ • Financial resources\\ • Support of Loyalists\\ • Offered freedom to slaves who joined Britain\\ • Native American alliances\\ • Continental army was underfunded because Congress could not levy taxes, tried to print money → inflation\\ |• Allied with the French\\ • British were far from home\\ • Fighting a defensive war\\ • Patriot soldiers believed in their cause\\ • Strong leadership: Washington, Nathanael Greene, Henry Knox\\ |

|**Phase 1**|The British thought that the revolution was started by a minority, and suffered heavy losses (although they won) in the Battle of Bunker Hill, and retreated from New England|
|**Phase 2**|The British tried to gain control of New York to isolate New England and drove Washington and his troops out of New York in 1776\\ However, they were defeated at the Battle of Saratoga, which convinced France to lend a hand\\ |
|**Phase 3**|In the South, Britain hoped to rally Loyalist sentiments and the resentment of the slaves, but French aid led Cornwallis to surrender at the Battle of Yorktown|

===== Articles of Confederation (Effect of Revolution) =====

**Issues**

|**Lack of Political Power**|• Loose collection of states\\ • No power to enforce laws\\ • Could only request money and troops from the states\\ |
|**Lack of Economic Power**|• No power to impose taxes, tariffs, or regulate interstate commerce\\ •\\ Shay’s Rebellion: veterans had not been paid for the war and were being taxed → rebellion|

**Northwest Ordinance of 1787**: Set up a process where territories could apply to become states and banned slavery north of the Ohio River

===== Constitution =====

|**Constitutional Convention**|**Responses**|
|• ⅗ Compromise counted slaves as ⅗ of a man for representation\\ • Great Compromise meshed the Virginia and New Jersey plans to create the Senate and House\\ • Division of Power - Congress, SCOTUS, President\\ |• Bill of Rights: Antifederalists agreed to ratify if it was passed, protecting rights of states and the people\\ • 10th Amendment left all undelegated power to states\\ •\\ Federalist Papers: Written by Madison, Jay, and Hamilton who urged ratification|

===== America in Infancy =====

|**Federalists**|**Democratic Republicans**|
|• John Adams, Hamilton\\ • Favored a powerful national government\\ • Merchants, bankers, landowners\\ • Centered in New England\\ • Government should be controlled by rich, well born, well educated\\ • Distrusted the common man\\ •\\ Loose interpretation of Constitution\\ • Tended to favor Britain (criticized as the monarchist party)\\ |• Madison, Jefferson\\ • Favored limited role of national government\\ • Shop owners, city workers, farmers\\ • Support based in South and West\\ • Government controlled by capable leaders\\ • Favored individual liberties\\ •\\ Strict interpretation of Constitution (elastic clause)\\ • Tended to favor France\\ |

|**Washington**|• Precedent: chose secretaries of state, war, and treasury; served no more than 2 terms; peaceful transfer of power\\ • Maintained neutrality: French Revolution\\ • Pinckney’s Treaty (Spain): US gets right of deposit of the Mississippi River\\ |
|**Hamilton**|• National Bank to hold government tax revenues and stabilized the economy - use elastic clause to achieve this\\ • Insisted that national war debt (bonds) be paid back in full to enhance the bank’s legitimacy and assume states’ debts - met with opposition by states that did not have large debt\\ • Encouraged manufacturing by imposing tariffs on foreign goods\\ • Whiskey (Excise) Tax - Hit grain farmers hard → Whiskey Rebellion (put down by Washington’s troops)\\ |
|**Adams**|• XYZ Affair: American negotiators (to stop the seizure of American ships) were offered a bribe by French agents\\ • Quasi War: undeclared war - instilled respect for America’s navy\\ • Alien and Sedition Acts: allowed deportation of aliens and silenced government criticism during the Quasi War\\ • Kentucky/Virginia Resolutions: Jefferson and Madison asserted that states could nullify government laws if they were unconstitutional\\ |

===== Big Ideas =====

  * Overview
    * America begins as the colonial partner of Britain
    * French and Indian War expenses led to increasing conflict between the mother country and the colonies
    * Ideas about independence inspired patriots to declare independence
    * Americans experimented with forms of government - state constitutions, Articles, and Constitution
    * Washington and Adams breathed life into the Constitution and created institutions for the American experiment
    * Power of national government
      * British government vs. Colonies

|**Causes**|• Impressment of sailors\\ • Resentment of British leftover from the Revolution\\ • Belief that British were arming/inciting Indians in west\\ • British did not abandon posts and forts in North America\\ • War-hawks elected to Congress in 1812\\ • American territorial ambitions for Florida and Canada\\ |
|**Timeline**|• The war lasted 2 ½ years - Britain won early battles at Fort Dearborn and Fort Detroit, but in 1813, the US burned the city of York and won the Battle of the Thames in Canada where they defeated British and Indian forces and killed the Indian leader Tecumseh|
|**Effects**|• Hartford Convention: Federalists meet to oppose fighting the war, but seem traitorous when Americans win - **ends the Federalist Party**\\ • Treaty of Ghent: No territorial changes,\\ impressment not addressed\\ • Growth of American Nationalism\\ |

**Postwar America Politics and Policies**

|**American System**|• Henry Clay’s 3 part plan: protective tariff, 2nd National Bank, building roads and canals\\ • Plan was to have the South exchange agricultural goods with the North’s manufactured goods\\ |
|**Missouri Compromise**|• Admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state to keep the balance\\ • Divided the Louisiana territory at the 36 30 line - slavery was banned north of the line\\ |
|**Monroe Doctrine**|• Banned the Western hemisphere from European Colonization\\ • European attempts to intervene would be seen as dangerous\\ |

|**Jackson’s Policies**|• Expanded role of President: used veto 12 times\\ • Specie Circular (because of suspicion of bankers and credit, government land could only be sold for hard currency) and\\ destruction of the 2nd National Bank led to the Panic of 1837 (economic crisis that stopped infrastructure building, led to business collapse, and high unemployment)\\ • Indian Removal Act - relocated them to Oklahoma (Trail of Tears)\\ |
|**Nullification Crisis**|• When SC passed a resolution nullifying the Tariff Act of 1828 (as they depended heavily on cotton exports), he authorized military action against them|

===== Age of Reform =====

**Second Great Awakening (Cause of Reform)**

  * At beginning of the 1800s, many clergy members worried that Americans were more captivated by politics than God and Salvation, and Americans felt a yearning for a more immediate religious experience

  * Second Great Awakening ministers such as Finney told people they could control their eternal life, much different from predestination, which encouraged individual redemption and even societal reformation

  * It acted as a springboard for a variety of reform movements

----

**Reforms**

|**Temperance**|• Many women were troubled by their husbands spending all their income on alcohol and domestic abuse\\ • Tried to limit or ban the sale and consumption of alcohol\\ • Temporarily reduced alcohol consumption by ½ in the US, but did not last through the 1870s\\ • EXAMPLE\\ |

  * America underwent an economic and technological revolution - cotton gin, steam engine, factory system, and railroads and canals

  * The US expanded after the Louisiana Purchase - wanted to be a major player in foreign trade

  * The debate over slavery raged on - the Missouri Compromise resolved some tension for the next 3 decades

  * By the 1820s and 30s, new parties arose - the Democrats (Andrew Jackson) and the Whigs (Clay) - that disagreed about the role and powers of the federal government and issues such as the national bank, tariffs, and federally funded internal improvement

  * The rise of democratic and individual beliefs, rationalism, and changes caused by the market revolution, along with greater social and geographical mobility, contributed to various reform movements

===== Period 5 (Manifest Destiny, Civil War, Reconstruction) =====

===== Manifest Destiny =====

|**Causes**|• Population increase\\ • Economic depressions - 1819 and 1837 (Panics)\\ • Abundance of cheap (or free) land in West\\ • Expansion offered opportunities for new commerce\\ • People began moving over new trails like Santa Fe Trail and Oregon Trail\\ |
|**Timeline**|• Belief that God determined America should stretch from Atlantic to Pacific\\ • Believed that US had mission to extend boundaries of freedom to others by sharing idealism and democratic institutions\\ •\\ James K. Polk = Manifest Destiny\\ •\\ Mexican American War: US gained the Mexican Cession - debate over whether or not to permit slavery in these territories; Wilmot Proviso would ban slavery in Mexican Cession|
|**Effects**|• Increased tensions between settlers and natives, abolitionists and slaveholders\\ •\\ Sectionalism\\ •\\ Compromise of 1850: stricter Fugitive Slave Law, admission of CA as free state, popular sovereignty in NM and UT|

===== Civil War =====

**Causes**

|**Slavery / Sectionalism**|• Dred Scott decision: Dred Scott sues on the basis that he lived in a free state and was a free man, and was being forced into slavery\\ • SCOTUS ruled that Scott was still a slave and could not initiate a lawsuit, and declared that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that Congress cannot ban slavery in any territory\\ |
|**Extremism**|• John Brown raided the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry to arm and incite a generalized slave revolt in the south; was executed and became a martyr\\ •\\ Senator Sumner was beat with a cane after condemning slavery acts in Kansas|
|**Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854**|• Let Kansas and Nebraska determine slaves by popular sovereignty (even though they were above the Missouri Compromise line)\\ •\\ Bleeding Kansas: Pro-slavery border ruffians came into these states to vote, violence broke out, Pierce ended up recognizing the pro-slavery governments\\ • Formation of Republican Party: dedicated to stopping the expansion of slavery into “free” soil; defended “free labor” ideology\\ |
|**Election of 1860/Secession**|• Lincoln was elected in 1860\\ • SC and 6 other states seceded the following year, forming the Confederate States of America\\ • Confederacy fired on Fort Sumter, and Lincoln rallied 75,000 troops after Confederates\\ |

|**North Advantages**|**South Advantages**|
|• Greater population (much of the southern population was slaves)\\ • Greater military capacity\\ • Border States were loyal to Union\\ • Extensive railroad network\\ • This allowed the Union to resupply its troops and bring reinforcements as the war dragged on\\ |• Fighting a defensive war\\ • Did not have to invade the North to win, just had to fight on home soil\\ • South’s rich military tradition - had able generals and a cohort of military men to draw from\\ |

**Union’s 3 Part Strategy**

  - Anaconda Plan: The navy would blockade southern ports to prevent supplies from reaching the South and prevent Southern exports to stifle economy

  - Divide Confederate territory in half by taking control of the Mississippi River

  - Troops march on the confederate capital of Richmond, VA to achieve victory

----

**Trajectory of the War**

|**Beginning**|• Union suffered many defeats: First/Second Battle of Bull Run, etc.\\ • Lincoln went through many incompetent generals before\\ Grant\\ • Battle of\\ Antietam: Slight Union victory, McClellan repels Confederate forces in bloodiest day of fighting\\ • Successfully execute Anaconda Plan\\ |
|**Turning Point**|• Battle of Gettysburg: Confederacy was now on the retreat|
|**End**|• Victory at Vicksburg: gained control of Mississippi River\\ • Sherman’s\\ March to the Sea: military campaign designed to raid and loot civilians; destroy their morale so they would beg for the war to end\\ • Robert E. Lee surrenders to Grant at the Appomattox Courthouse\\ |

**Abraham Lincoln**

|**Emancipation Proclamation**|• Waited until Union achieved a victory (Antietam)\\ • Freed slaves in states of\\ rebellion (not border states that were part of Union)\\ • Not universally applauded by North\\ |
|**Gettysburg Address**|• Framed the war as fulfilling the US’s democratic goals\\ • After Civil War, US was referred to as a nation, not just a union of states\\ |
|**10% Plan**|• If 10% of the voting population in Southern states swore loyalty to the Union, they would be let back in|

===== Reconstruction (Effect of the War) =====

**Effects of Reconstruction**

Reconstruction: process of readmitting the former Confederate states into the Union

  - Cities, towns, and farms ruined

  - High food prices and crop failures → many southerners faced starvation

  - Confederate money because worthless → Banks failed and merchants became bankrupt → people couldn’t pay their debts

----

**Amendments**

----

===== Big Ideas =====

  * Americans enthusiastically supported Western expansion in hopes of finding economic opportunities - Manifest Destiny

  * The Compromise of 1850, Kansas-Nebraska Act, and Dred Scott decision were precursors to the Civil War

  * Debates about slavery led to a widening gap between North and South

  * Due to superior military strategy, more resources, larger population, and better infrastructure, the Union defeated the Confederacy

  * After the Civil War, the 13th Amendment officially ended slavery, and the 14th and 15th Amendments further expanded the rights of blacks

===== Period 6 (Postwar South, Gilded Age/Industrialization) =====

===== Postwar South =====

**Characteristics**

|**New South**|• Coined by Henry Grady, he urged the South to abandon its longstanding agrarian economy for a modern economy grounded in factories, mines, and mills\\ • Largely a\\ failure, income in the South was less than the national average and rural poverty persisted|

Morgan: a financier who gained control of the economy through financing railroads|

**Labor**

|**Working Class**|• Fierce industrial competition worsened working conditions\\ • Panics, child labor, and immigrants led to decreases in wages\\ • Production/separation of processes led to an increase in unsafe and unsanitary conditions\\ • Also led to unskilled tasks → women and children entered into the workforce\\ • However, industrialization did lead to a decrease in the price of goods\\ |
|**Strikes and Unions**|• Labor battles were almost always won by management because of their economic and political power, and backing of the government\\ •\\ American Federation of Labor (AFL): federation of unions of skilled workers that argued for better wages, hours, and conditions\\ •\\ Great Railroad Strike of 1877: a strike at McCormick Reaper Works led to jobs of striking workers being given to replacements (scabs); police fired on strikers rallying in Haymarket Square\\ •\\ Homestead Strike: fight erupted between union workers and hired Pinkerton guards in Carnegie’s steel plant\\ •\\ Pullman Strike: Railroad workers went on strike, causing trains to come to a standstill; federal troops killed 25 and put the strike down|

**Key Concepts**

===== Period 1 (1491 - 1607): 4-6% =====

  - **​As native populations migrated and settled across the vast expanse of North America over time, they developed distinct and increasingly complex societies by adapting to and transforming their diverse environments.**
    - Different native societies adapted to and transformed their environments through innovations in agriculture, resource use, and social structure.
      - The spread of maize cultivation from present-day Mexico northward into the present-day American Southwest and beyond supported economic development, settlement, advanced irrigation, and social diversification among societies.
        * Ex. Pueblo, Navajo
      - Societies responded to the aridity of the Great Basin and the grasslands of the western Great Plains by developing largely mobile lifestyles.
        * Ex. Sioux, Apache
      - In the Northeast, the Mississippi River Valley, and along the Atlantic seaboard some societies developed mixed agricultural and hunter--gatherer economies that favored the development of permanent villages.
        * Ex. Iroquois Confederacy of the Northeast, Creek, Choctaw, or Cherokee of the Southeast
      - Societies in the Northwest and present-day California supported themselves by hunting and gathering, and in some areas developed settled communities supported by the vast resources of the ocean.
        * Ex. Chinook, Nez Perce, Shoshone

  - **Contact among Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans resulted in the Columbian Exchange and significant social, cultural, and political changes on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.**
    - European expansion into the western hemisphere generated intense social, religious, policial, and economic competition and changes within European societies
      - European nations’ efforts to explore and conquer the New World stemmed from a search for new sources of wealth, economic and military competition, and a desire to spread Christianity.
        * Ex. “3 Gs”: Gold, God, and Glory, founding of St. Augustine (1565), Northwest Passage, Roanoke Island
      - The Columbian Exchange brought new crops to Europe from the Americas, stimulating European population growth, and new sources of mineral wealth, which facilitated the European shift from feudalism to capitalism.
        * Ex. Introduction of corn, potatoes, and tomatoes to Europe, growth of European nation-states
      - Improvements in maritime technology and more organized methods for conducting international trade, such as joint-stock companies, helped drive changes to economies in Europe and the Americas.
        * Ex. Caravel, sextant, joint-stock trading company
    - The Columbian Exchange and development of the Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere resulted in extensive demographic, economic and social changes
      - Spanish exploration and conquest were accompanied and furthered by widespread deadly epidemics that devastated native populations and by the introduction of crops and animals not found in the Americas.
        * Ex. Spread of smallpox; European introduction of horses, rice, wheat, and oxen to the New World; bison hunting on the Great Plains
      - In the encomienda system, Spanish colonial economies marshaled Native American labor to support plantation-based agriculture and extract precious metals and other resources.
        * Ex. Sugar plantations, silver mines, Black Legend
      - European traders partnered with some African groups who practiced slavery to forcibly extract slave labor for the Americas. The Spanish imported enslaved Africans to labor in plantation agriculture and mining.
        * Ex. Line of Demarcation, Middle Passage
      - The Spanish developed a caste system that incorporated, and carefully defined the status of, the diverse population of Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans in their empire.
        * Ex. Mestizo, Zambo, mulatto
    - In their interactions, Europeans and Native Americans asserted divergent worldviews regarding issues such as religion, gender roles, family, land use, and power.
      - Mutual misunderstandings between Europeans and Native Americans often defined the early years of interaction and trade as each group sought to make sense of the other. Over time, Europeans and Native Americans adopted some useful aspects of each other’s culture.
        * Ex. African religious traditions combined with Christian traditions, Maroon communities
      - As European encroachments on Native Americans’ lands and demands on their labor increased, native peoples sought to defend and maintain their political sovereignty, economic prosperity, religious beliefs, and concepts of gender relations through diplomatic negotiations and military resistance.
        * Ex. Spanish mission system, Juan de Onate, Acoma War and defeat of the Pueblo (1599)
      - Extended contact with Native Americans and Africans fostered debate among European religious and political leaders about how non-Europeans should be treated, as well as evolving religious, cultural, and racial justifications for the subjugation of Africans and Native Americans.
        * Ex. Juan de Sepulveda, Bartolome de Las Casas, communal nature of land, private vs. public ownership of land, animism.

===== Period 2 (1607 - 1754): 6-8% =====

  - **Europeans developed a variety of colonization and migration patterns, influenced by different imperial goals, cultures, and the varied North American environments where they settled, and they competed with each other and American Indians for resources**
    - Spanish, French, Dutch, and British colonizers had different economic and imperial goals involving land and labor that shaped the social and political development of their colonies as well as their relationships with native populations.
      - Spanish efforts to extract wealth from the land led them to develop institutions based on subjugating native populations, converting them to Christianity, and incorporating them, along with enslaved and free Africans, into the Spanish colonial society.
        * Ex. Christopher Columbus, Cortez, Pizarro, conquistadores, mission system, encomienda system, New Spain, establishment of Santa Fe (1610)
      - French and Dutch colonial efforts involved relatively few Europeans and relied on trade alliances and intermarriage with American Indians to build economic and diplomatic relationships and acquires furs and other products for export to Europe.
        * Ex. Samuel de Champlain, Coureurs de bois, New Netherland, Jesuit missionaries, French alliance with Huron Indians
      - English colonization efforts attracted a comparatively large number of male and female British migrants, as well as other European migrants, all of whom sought social mobility, economic prosperity, religious freedom, and improved living conditions. These colonists focused on agriculture and settled on land taken from Native Americans, from whom they lived separately.
        * Ex. Jamestown (1607), starving time, head-right system, John Rolfe, tobacco as cash crop
    - In the 17th century, early British colonies developed along the Atlantic coast, with regional differences that reflected various environmental, economic, cultural, and demographic factors.
      - The Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies grew prosperous exporting tobacco — a labor-intensive product initially cultivated by white, mostly male indentured servants and later by enslaved Africans.
        * Ex. Middle Passage, indentured servants, Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), Chesapeake colonies, racial hierarchy
      - The New England colonies, initially settled by Puritans, developed around small towns with family farms and achieved a thriving mixed economy of agriculture and commerce.
        * Ex. Puritan work ethic, town meetings, expanded life expectancy in New England, social hierarchy, blue laws, subsistence farming, John Winthrop’s “city upon a hill”, Salem witch trials, trial of Anne Hutchinson, banishment of Roger Williams, establishment of Harvard College (1636)
      - The middle colonies supported a flourishing export economy based on cereal crops and attracted a broad range of European migrants, leading to societies with greater cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity and tolerance.
        * Ex. William Penn, Quakers, religious toleration, “middle way”, ethnic diversity, “bread-basket colonies”
      - The colonies of the southernmost Atlantic coast and the British West Indies used long growing seasons to develop plantation economies based on exporting staple crops. They depended on the labor of enslaved Africans, who often constituted the majority of the population in these areas and developed their own forms of cultural and religious autonomy.
        * Ex. rice as cash crop in Georgia and the Carolinas, sugar as cash crop in Barbados, slave codes, Gullah, ring-shout, spirituals
      - Distance and Britain’s initially lax attention led to the colonies creating self-governing institutions that were unusually democratic for the era. The New England colonies based power in participatory town meetings, which in turn elected members to their colonial legislatures; in the Southern colonies, elite planters exercised local authority and also dominated the elected assemblies.
        * Ex. Mayflower Compact (1620), Maryland Toleration Act (1649), House of Burgesses, Massachusetts General Court
    - Competition over resources between European rivals and American Indians encouraged industry and trade and led to conflict in the Americas.
      - An Atlantic economy developed in which goods, as well as enslaved Africans and American Indians, were exchanged between Europe, Africa, and theAmericas through extensive trade networks. European colonial economies focused on acquiring, producing, and exporting commodities that were valued in Europe and gaining new sources of labor.
        * Ex. Triangular trade routes, direct trade routes, Middle Passage
      - Continuing trade with Europeans increased the flow of goods in and out of American Indian communities, stimulating cultural and economic changes and spreading epidemic diseases that caused radical demographic shifts.
        * Ex. Praying towns, fur trade
      - Interactions between European rivals and American Indian populations fostered both accommodation and conflict. French, Dutch, British, and Spanish colonies allied with and armed American Indian groups, who frequently sought alliances with Europeans against other Indian groups.
        * Ex. Beaver Wars of the mid-1600s, Chickasaw Wars of the mid-1700s, King William’s War (1688-1697), Queen Anne’s War (1702-1713), King George’s War (1744-1748)
      - The goals and interests of European leaders and colonists at times diverged, leading to a growing mistrust on both sides of the Atlantic. Colonists, especially in British North America, expressed dissatisfaction over issues including territorial settlements, frontier defense, self-rule, and trade.
        * Ex. Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), revocation of Massachusetts’ charter, Navigation Acts/smuggling, protests against the Dominion of New England
      - British conflicts with American Indians over land, resources, and political boundaries led to military confrontations, such as Metacom’s War (King Philip’s War) in New England.
        * Ex. Anglo-Powhatan Wars (1610-1640s), Pequot War (1636-1637), King Philip’s War (1675-1676)
      - American Indian resistance to Spanish colonizing efforts in North America, particularly after the Pueblo Revolt, led to Spanish accommodation of some aspects of American Indian culture in the Southwest.
        * Ex. Caste system, mulattoes, mestizos, Pueblo Revolt (1680)

  - **The British colonies participated in policial, social, cultural, and economic exchanges with Great Britain that encouraged both stronger bonds with Britain and resistance to British control**
    - Transatlantic commercial, religious, philosophical, and political exchanges led residents of the British colonies to evolve in their political and cultural attitudes as they became increasingly tied to Britain and one another.
      - The presence of different European religious and ethnic groups contributed to a significant degree of pluralism and intellectual exchange, which were later enhanced by the First Great Awakening and the spread of European Enlightenment ideas.
        * Ex. Great Awakening, Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, “new lights vs. old lights”, Enlightenment, John Locke
      - The British colonies experienced a gradual Anglicization over time, developing autonomous political communities based on English models with influence from inter-colonial commercial ties, the emergence of a trans-Atlantic print culture, and the spread of Protestant evangelicalism.
        * Ex. Anglicization, republicanism, salutary neglect, trial of John Peter Zenger
      - The British government increasingly attempted to incorporate its North American colonies into a coherent, hierarchical, and imperial structure in order to pursue mercantilist economic aims, but conflicts with colonists and American Indians led to erratic enforcement of imperial policies.
        * Ex. Mercantilism, Board of Trade, Navigation Act of the 1660s, Dominion of New England, Wool Act of 1699, Molasses Act of 1733
      - Colonists’ resistance to imperial control drew on local experiences of self- government, evolving ideas of liberty, the political thought of the Enlightenment, greater religious independence and diversity, and an ideology critical of perceived corruption in the imperial system.
        * Ex. Widespread smuggling, Dominion of New England/Edmund Andros, First Great Awakening (J. Edwards & G. Whitefield), John Locke
    - Like other European empires in the Americas that participated in the Atlantic slave trade, the English colonies developed a system of slavery that reflected the specific economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics of those colonies.
      - All the British colonies participated to varying degrees in the Atlantic slave trade due to the abundance of land and a growing European demand forcolonial goods, as well as a shortage of indentured servants. Small New England farms used relatively few enslaved laborers, all port cities held significant minorities of enslaved people, and the emerging plantation systems of the Chesapeake and the southernmost Atlantic coast had large numbers of enslaved workers, while the great majority of enslaved Africans were sent to the West Indies.
        * Ex. Triangular trade, Middle Passage, plantation agriculture
      - As chattel slavery became the dominant labor system in many southern colonies, new laws created a strict racial system that prohibited interracial relationships and defined the descendants of African American mothers as black and enslaved in perpetuity.
        * Ex. Barbados slave code, Stone Rebellion of 1739, NYC slave revolt of 1741
      - Africans developed both overt and covert means to resist the dehumanizing aspects of slavery and maintain their family and gender systems, culture, and religion.
        * Ex. Work slowdowns, runaway slaves, NYC slave revolt (1711), Stono Rebellion (1739)

===== Period 3 (1754 - 1800): 10-17% =====

  - **British attempts to assert tighter control over its North American colonies and the colonial resolve to pursue self government led to a colonial independence movement and the Revolutionary War**
    - The competition among the British, French, and American Indians for economic and political advantage in North America culminated in the Seven years’ War (the French and Indian War), in which Britain defeated France and allied American Indians.
      - Colonial rivalry intensified between Britain and France in the mid-18th century, as the growing population of the British colonies expanded into the interior of North America, threatening French--Indian trade networks and American Indian autonomy.
        * Ex. French-Huron alliance, British-Iroquois alliance, French and Indian War, Albany Plan of Union, Treaty of Paris
      - Britain achieved a major expansion of its territorial holdings by defeating the French, but at tremendous expense, setting the stage for imperial efforts to raise revenue and consolidate control over the colonies.
        * Ex. End of salutary neglect, writs of assistance, use of admiralty courts to try smugglers, virtual representation of Parliament
      - After the British victory, imperial officials’ attempts to prevent colonists from moving westward generated colonial opposition, while native groups sought to both continue trading with Europeans and resist the encroachments of colonists on tribal lands.
        * Ex. Pontiac’s War, Proclamation of 1763, Iroquois Confederacy, Chief Little Turtle and the Western Confederacy (1793-1795)
    - The desire of many colonists to assert ideals of self-government in the face of renewed British imperial efforts led to a colonial independence movement and war with Britain
      - The imperial struggles of the mid-18th century, as well as new British efforts to collect taxes without direct colonial representation or consent and to assert imperial authority in the colonies, began to unite the colonists against perceived and real constraints on their economic activities and political rights.
        * Ex. Sugar Act (1764), Stamp Act (1765), Quartering Act (1765), Declaratory Act (1766), Townshend Acts (1767), Tea Act (1773), Intolerable Acts (1774), Quebec Act (1774)
      - Colonial leaders based their calls for resistance to Britain on arguments about the rights of British subjects, the rights of the individual, local traditions of self-rule, and the ideas of the Enlightenment.
        * Ex. Taxation without representation, consent of the governed, republicanism, bicameral colonial legislatures, natural rights
      - The effort for American independence was energized by colonial leaders such as Benjamin Franklin, as well as by popular movements that included the political activism of laborers, artisans, and women.
        * Ex. Otis Warren, Paul Revere, Mercy Otis Warren, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Sons of Liberty, Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania (John Dickinson), Stamp Act Congress (1765), Boston Tea Party, committees of correspondence, First and Second Continental Congress
      - In the face of economic shortages and the British military occupation of some regions, men and women mobilized in large numbers to provide financial and material support to the Patriot movement.
        * Ex. Committees of Correspondence, Minutemen of Massachusetts
      - Despite considerable loyalist opposition, as well as Great Britain’s apparently overwhelming military and financial advantages, the Patriot cause succeeded because of the actions of colonial militias and the Continental Army, George Washington’s military leadership, the colonists’ ideological commitment and resilience, and assistance sent by European allies.
        * Ex. Battle of Trenton, Battle of Saratoga, French Alliance, Battle of Yorktown

  - **The American Revolution’s democratic and republican ideas inspired new experiments with different forms of government**
    - The ideals that inspired the revolutionary cause reflected new beliefs about politics, religion, and society that had been developing over the course of the18th century.
      - Enlightenment ideas and philosophy inspired many American political thinkers to emphasize individual talent over hereditary privilege, while religion strengthened Americans’ view of themselves as a people blessed with liberty.
        * Ex. End of primogeniture laws, First Great Awakening, New Lights vs. Old Lights, consent of the governed, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau
      - The colonists’ belief in the superiority of republican forms of government based on the natural rights of the people found expression in Thomas Paine’s Common Sense and the Declaration of Independence. The ideas in these documents resonated throughout American history, shaping Americans’ understanding of the ideals on which the nation was based.
        * Ex. Common Sense, Declaration of Independence, republicanism, natural rights
      - During and after the American Revolution, an increased awareness of inequalities in society motivated some individuals and groups to call for the abolition of slavery and greater political democracy in the new state and national governments.
        * Ex. Quakers, Abigail Adams’ “remember the ladies”, Pennsylvania gradual emancipation law (1780), Vermont constitution abolished slavery, reduction of state property requirements to vote, abolition societies, separation of church and state, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (1786)
      - In response to women’s participation in the American Revolution, Enlightenment ideas, and women’s appeals for expanded roles, an ideal of “republican motherhood” gained popularity. It called on women to teach republican values within the family and granted women a new importance in American political culture.
        * Ex. Republican motherhood, improved education for women, republican virtues of liberty and natural rights,
      - The American Revolution and the ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence reverberated in France, Haiti, and Latin America, inspiring future independence movements.
        * Ex. French Revolution (1789-1799), US Neutrality Proclamation, Haitian Revolution (1791-1804)
    - After declaring independence, American political leaders created new constitutions and declarations of rights that articulated the role of the state and federal governments while protecting individual liberties and limiting both centralized power and excessive popular influence.
      - Many new state constitutions placed power in the hands of the legislative branch and maintained property qualifications for voting and citizenship.
        * Ex. Conventions to ratify constitutions, fundamental laws, strong state legislatures combined with weak governors and courts
      - The Articles of Confederation unified the newly independent states, creating a central government with limited power.

    - Ideological and economic differences over slavery produced an array of diverging responses from Americans in the North and the South.
      - The North’s expanding manufacturing economy relied on free labor in contrast to the Southern economy’s dependence on slave labor.

    - The North’s greater manpower and industrial resources, the leadership of Abraham Lincoln and others, and the decision to emancipate slaves eventually led to the Union military victory over the Confederacy in the devastating Civil War.
      - Both the Union and the Confederacy mobilized their economies and societies to wage the war even while facing considerable home front opposition.

      - Efforts by radical and moderate Republicans to change the balance of power between Congress and the presidency and to reorder race relations in the defeated South yielded some short-term successes. Reconstruction opened up political opportunities and other leadership roles to former slaves, but it ultimately failed, due both to determined Southern resistance and the North’s waning resolve.

Former slaves sought land ownership but generally fell short of self-sufficiency, as an exploitative and soil-intensive sharecropping system limited blacks’ and poor whites’ access to land in the South.
        * Ex. black codes, sharecropping, tenant farming, crop-lien system, peonage system, Freedmen’s Bureau (1865)
      - Segregation, violence, Supreme Court decisions, and local political tactics progressively stripped away African American rights, but the 14th and 15th Amendments eventually became the basis for court decisions upholding civil rights in the 20th century.
        * Ex. Compromise of 1877, poll taxes, literacy tests to vote, Jim Crow laws, grandfather clauses. Civil Rights Cases (1883), Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)

    - Economic pressures, global events, and political developments caused sharp variations in the numbers, sources, and experiences of both international and internal migrants.
      - Immigration from Europe reached its peak in the years before World War I. During and after World War I, nativist campaigns against some ethnic groups led to the passage of quotas that restricted immigration, particularly from southern and eastern Europe, and increased barriers to Asian immigration.
      - The increased demand for war production and labor during World War I and World War II and the economic difficulties of the 1930s led many Americans to migrate to urban centers in search of economic opportunities.

      - Mobilization and military service provided opportunities for women and minorities to improve their socioeconomic positions for the war’s duration, while also leading to debates over racial segregation. Wartime experiences also generated challenges to civil liberties, such as the internment of Japanese Americans.
      - The United States and its allies achieved military victory through Allied cooperation, technological and scientific advances, the contributions of servicemen and women, and campaigns such as Pacific “island-hopping” and the D-Day invasion. The use of atomic bombs hastened the end of the war and sparked debates about the morality of using atomic weapons.
      - The war-ravaged condition of Asia and Europe, and the dominant U.S. role in the Allied victory and postwar peace settlements, allowed the United States to emerge from the war as the most powerful nation on earth.

        * Ex. The Feminine Mystique, Gloria Steinem
      - Latinos, American Indians, and Asian Americans began to demand social and economic equality and a redress of past injustices.
      - Despite the perception of overall affluence in postwar America, advocates raised awareness of the prevalence and persistence of poverty as a national problem, sparking efforts to address this issue.
    - As many liberal principles came to dominate postwar politics and court decisions, liberalism came under attack from the left as well as from resurgent conservative movements.

      - Liberal ideals were realized in Supreme Court decisions that expanded democracy and individual freedoms, Great Society social programs and policies, and the power of the federal government, yet these unintentionally helped energize a new conservative movement that mobilized to defend traditional visions of morality and the proper role of state authority.
        * Ex. Griswold v. Connecticut, Miranda v. Arizona
      - Groups on the left also assailed liberals, claiming they did too little to transform the racial and economic status quo at home and pursued immoral policies abroad.

    - The U.S. population continued to undergo significant demographic shifts that had profound cultural and political consequences.
      - After 1980, the political, economic, and cultural influences of the American South and West continued to increase as the population shifted to those areas, fueled in part by a surge in migration from regions that had not been heavily represented in earlier migrations, especially Latin America and Asia.
      - The new migrants affected U.S. culture in many ways and supplied the economy with an important labor force, but they also became the focus of intense political, economic, and cultural debates.

    * %%^%%^sets up complexity and fulfills the rubric requirements

  * Contextualization
    * 1 paragraph 3-4 sentences that sets the stage for your argument. Technically while you can write context anywhere in your LEQ it’s better to write it before your established argument since a majority of students have found that easier
    * Use specific historical evidence
      * Demonstrate how this evidence is related and sets up your argument

  * Evidence
    * Bare minimum of 2 pieces of evidence (I recommend not doing that unless you just can’t think of more than 2)
    * Describe and argue evidence
      * Describing: naming and defining
      * Arguing: set up topic sentence → describing evidence → weave the counterargument from thesis as an “argument” to strengthen your evidence and work towards earning complexity

  * Analysis and reasoning
    * Historical reasoning
      * Explain where the document sits in its larger historical context
    * Complexity
      * Weave counterargument throughout essay (as aforementioned above in evidence)

**How to Write: DBQ**

====== Preface: ======

DBQ information is sourced from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d807y5m8VRY&amp;ab_channel=Heimler%27sHistory|Heimler's History]].

====== Understanding the basics: ======

  * Time is combined with LEQ - 1 hour and 40 minutes or 100 minutes for both
    * Recommended to take 15 minutes reading through all the documents and spend 45 minutes for writing

====== Possible Approach: ======

  * When reading documents note:
    * What is the source of the document?
    * Who is speaking and to whom?
    * Where in the timelines does this document sit?

  * Summarize the main idea of each document, also categorize them in correspondence to the prompt

  * Thesis (0-1 pt)
    * Write one or two sentence which are historically defensible and establish a line of reasoning (AKA don’t restate the prompt)
    * Use specific historical evidence, remember that you aren’t creating an overarching umbrella like you do in AP Lang (hi Mr. V)
      * Example (the same as LEQ):
      * Despite [counterargument], because [evidence 1] and [evidence 2], [argument]
      * %%^%%^sets up complexity and fulfills the rubric requirements

  * Contextualization
    * 1 paragraph 3-4 sentences that sets the stage for your argument. Technically while you can write context anywhere in your DBQ it’s better to write it before your established argument since a majority of students have found that easier
    * Use specific historical evidence
      * Demonstrate how this evidence is related and sets up your argument

  * Evidence
    * Use all 7 documents (to be safe in case you interpret a document incorrectly)
      * Don’t quote the documents, the graders already know the documents like it’s the back of their hand. It’ll save you time NOT quoting the documents
    * Evidence beyond the documents
      * Using outside evidence not found in the documents (gets you one point)
    * Topic sentence
      * More of an overarching idea for the paragraph that your evidence will support

  * Analysis and reasoning
    * Historical reasoning
      * Explain where the document sits in its larger historical context
    * Audience
      * Analyze for whom this document was produced
    * Purpose
      * Discuss what this document was intended to do
    * Point of View
      * WHY are they saying WHAT they said in the WAY that they are said it

  * Complexity
    * Compare similarities and differences with outside evidence or the evidence found within the documents

**MUST KNOW CONCEPTS**
