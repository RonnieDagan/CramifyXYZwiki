====== 2.6: Environmental Consequences of Connectivity 1200-1450 T ======

  * Two major categories of things that spread through trade networks
    * Agriculture, disease

  * Agriculture
    * Merchants traveled from place to place bringing new crops
      * **Champa rice** spread from Vietnam to China and was drought resistant with faster harvests

  * Japan was closed off from outside European influence
    * Originally, when dutch and portuguese arrived with merchants and missionaries, the Japanese were open to them
    * As the japanese noticed the growing European and Christian influence influence, they closed off all trade with europeans and tried to stop all foreign influence

  * British in India
    * British drove French out of India during the 7 Years’ War gaining significant influence in India
    * **British East India Company joint stock company that gained influence in India**

      * **Hacienda** system: Spanish government grants **haciendas** (land holdings) to **conquistadors** who could farm, lease, or control land
        * Once people started working for the lords, it was likely they wouldn't stop b/c they accumulated debt to the owners
        * Sugarcane and labor made owners very wealthy
      * **Encomienda** system: system of labor where the beneficiary of the encomienda system was granted responsibility for a certain number of natives

        * However, labor was temporary because of the contract so Chattel Slavery was favored

  * Brutal **Middle Passage**
    * Packed into ships made specifically to hold slaves across the Atlantic
      * So tightly packed that most of the slaves died from disease or suffocation before even arriving
    * Many slaves formed communities among the displaced

====== 4.5: Maritime Empires Maintained & Developed 1450-1750 t ======

  * Economic Strategies to increase power
    * Dominant economic system of the European colonizing states was **mercantilism**
      * **Mercantilism**: fixed amount of wealth in the world
        * Main principles:
        * Gaining wealth means someone else loses wealth
        * Wealth is measured in gold and silver
        * State’s main economic goal was to create a favorable balance of trade
          * Want more exports than imports
        * **Colonies** exist to enrich the mother country
          * Especially with raw materials

    * As religion spread into new territories, two responses
      * 1. **Syncretism**
        * Blending of two beliefs into one
        * Many africans melded their traditional religions with European Christianity
        * Many indigenous people in americas took christian beliefs and combined with celebration of their own holy days
      * 2. Conflict
        * Sunni/Shia divide
          * Intensified by **Ottoman** and **Safavid** (see un 3)
        * **Protestant reformation**
          * Split in Christian church that separated Roman Catholics from the newly formed Protestants
          * Split occurred for many reasons
            * Most important was different interpretation of the doctrine of salvation
            * Also selling of indulgences

====== 5.3: Industrial Revolution Begins 1750-1900 t ======

  * **Industrial Revolution: process of producing goods with machines in order to make labor more efficient**
    * Had a multitude of cultural and economic effects

  * Beginning in England and Reasons
    * 1. Proximity to water → Island country with abundant access to river and canals allowing for easy and inexpensive trade
    * 2. Lots of Raw materials → Lots of coal and iron in England
    * 3. Productive agriculture → advances in agriculture increased harvests
      * **Crop rotation** was introduced to maintain soil fertility
      * **Seed drill** allowed farmers to plant seeds in the right location and depth
    * 4. Urbanization → Higher population from higher amounts of food with productive agriculture
      * Less demand for labor on farms so many people moved to cities for jobs → migration
    * 5. Legal protection of private property → enabled entrepreneurs to take risks and build businesses without fearing for government taking what they worked for
    * 6. Access to foreign resources → England had created a global empire and thus had access to all raw materials of their colonies
      * Had colonies in all parts of the globe so had access to every material necessary
    * 7. Accumulation of Capital → British capitalists had generated a huge amount of capital, especially from the slave trade
      * They began to invest the capital into entrepreneurial opportunities

      * **Eli Whitney: created idea for interchangeable parts**
        * Before, weapons would have individual parts only for that model or brand. Eli Whitney said that the parts should be interchangeable between design of gun
        * Manufacturing became focused on parts of the product, not the whole product
        * Producers no longer needed skilled laborers, just needed people to do repetitive simple tasks that together would create factory system

      * Now ships could be transported in any direction with steam engines so trade in all industrialized nations increased (upstream rivers)
      * Trains did same
    * **Trans-siberian railroad** completed in Russia meant flourishing trade with eastern states like china
    * **Trans-continental railroad** in United states meant more trade and migration

    * Led by **U.S., U.K., Germany**
    * Used and produced **steel, gas power,** and **communications**
    * **Steel: stronger material than iron, began to become mass-produced**
      * **Bessemer Process: Blasting hot iron with air to remove impurities and creating steel**
      * Allowed people to create mass quantities of steel
    * **Gas Power**: by mid 1800s, oil wells drilled everywhere
      * **Raw oil** could be refined into **kerosene** and **gasoline**
      * Kerosene was used for lamps, but gasoline became main fuel sources in
      * **Internal combustion engine developed in late 19th century where ignited gasoline instead of steam pushed pistons**
    * Revolution in **Communication**
      * Major developments in harnessing electricity resulted in **telegraph**
        * Invented by **Samuel Morse** in 1830s and 40s, and it could send pulses of electricity in pulses of long and short bursts along electrical wires at great distances
        * **Alexander Graham Bell invented telephone in 1876**

  * Consequences of both IR
    * Increase of trade
      * New transport technologies with ships, locomotives, combustion engine
    * Waves of migration
      * Easier to move to different parts of the globe and communicate with family members left behind

  * Industrial workers themselves reacted to industrial change
    * Factory work was dangerous, with no safety regulations, high rate of disease, and poor air quality
      * People lost fingers and arms to the machines
      * The factory workers were paid little to nothing and they couldn’t quit because there was a line of unemployed workers to take their place
      * After working all day, many of the factory workers went home to **slums** and packed themselves into **tenements**, which spread disease

  * People began to resist by forming **labor unions**
    * A group of workers who organize themselves into a collective of workers using their combined voice for reform

      * **Cholera was very common, coming from contaminated water**
        * Resulted in severe vomiting, diarrhea, death
      * Tenements didn’t have **plumbing** so human waste was dumped onto streets or near water sources
        * During the time people didn’t understand that disease was spread through germs in waste
      * Eventually people realized they need to create **sewage** and waste removal processes to reduce disease

  * Overall rise in standard of living from industrial age, especially in the growing **middle class**

      * Labor unions and higher demand for workers increased salaries,
      * Labor unions also improved working conditions
    * Industrial capitalism also led to other improvements in living standards
      * Higher production of goods = higher variety available for purchase
      * Improvements in transportation as growth of factories and demand for goods increased need of transportation
        * Railroads, steamships, long distance
    * Living standards were increased through productivity
      * New technologies such as steam engine allowed for mass production

====== Unit 6: Consequences of Industrialization 1750-1900 ======

====== 6.1: Rationales for Imperialism 1750-1900 a ======

  * **Imperialism arose from IR**
    * Imperialistic fervor grew due to culture, nationalism, and economics
    * Most imperialistic advances were made by European powers
      * They believed in the superiority of the white race and their culture

  * Cultural reasons for Imperialism
    * Saw themselves as benevolent protectors to spread their “superior” culture to the rest of the world
      * Rudyard Kipling called it the white man’s burden
    * Another reason was Darwinism
      * Darwin argued for the survival of the fittest and some people applied these principles to society creating **Social Darwinism**
        * They argued that if nature is fighting for survival, strong nations should also take over weak nations
    * Religion
      * European christians spread throughout the world with a **missionary** zeal to convert the world
        * Empires needed a presence in as many places as possible for that to succeed
        * Missionaries established schools in imperial territories to teach religion, math, and science
        * Also created hospitals and helped stop the slave trade

  * Nationalist reasons for Imperialism
    * **Nationalism**: when a group of people who have a strong common identity become loyal to a single state
    * After losing American Colonies, Britain looked around world to see where else they could establish an empire
      * Imperialized all across the globe “The sun never set on the British Empire” and created very wealthy and important colonies
      * Most important was India

      * Japan had advanced weapons from modernizing in the Meiji Restoration and beat China, establishing Korea as a colony of their own

  * Economic motives for Imperialism
    * Industrial powers became hungry for more raw materials and new markets to sell manufactured goods to
    * British, Dutch, and French rulers chartered agreements with local rulers in India, the East Indies, and East Africa
    * Gave Europeans the right to establish these trading posts and the right to defend the trading posts
      * That allowed europeans to create armies for their trading posts and defend themselves which was very important
      * Britain became very powerful in 19th century in first IR and only became challenged after second IR

====== 6.2: State Expansion 1750-1900 t ======

  * Imperialism: when a country extends its power and influence into other lands, sometimes by diplomacy or sometimes by force

  * European expansion into Africa
    * Europe had been expanding its influence into Africa since the 1800s

  * When imperial nations pushed into new nations, often indigenous people found a surge of **nationalism**
    * Led to resistance against the encroachment of imperial powers

  * Americas:

  * Australia:
    * 1788, British established penal colony in Australia

      * Resulted in fierce nationalism as those countries rose against the ottomans and gained their independence

====== 6.4: Global Economic Development 1750-1900 t ======

  * As nations grew their industrial capacity, they found they needed more raw materials and food to feed workers

  * Agriculture
    * Before Europeans, most Africans engaged in **subsistence farming**
      * They only farmed enough for them to live on
      * Europeans replaced subsistence with **cash crop** farming
      * Cash crops are crops that are grown not to live from but for sale in a distant market
    * African plantations were dedicated to cash crops such as **coffee, rubber,** or **sugar**
      * They were exported to foreign markets
    * Increase in demand for **beef** (meat)
      * Rising consumer class, people wanted more meat
      * Colonies in **Argentina** and **Uruguay** raising large amounts of cows who were then refrigerated and shipped to europe using the new technology
    * **Guano**: bat and seabird poop
      * As agriculture increased, so did demand for fertilizer
      * Guano in Peru and Argentina had been piling up for centuries so it became a huge part of Peru and Chile’s export economy

  * Raw materials
    * Factories needed raw materials to continue making manufactured goods
    * Turned to colonies to provide the raw materials
    * **Cotton**
      * During IR, 80% of cotton for British textiles was imported from America
      * During the **Civil War**, cotton production dropped dramatically
      * Britain turned to Egypt, and by the 1800s, 90+% of Egypt’s exports were cotton
        * Also turned to India for cotton
    * **Rubber**
      * Rubber was important for IR, it was used for tires, soles of shoes, hoses, gaskets for machines, etc.
      * Rubber comes from rubber tree grown in Amazon rainforest
        * Colonial powers forced natives to work at rubber extraction destroying land to plant rubber trees
    * **Palm oil**
      * Came from west africa, important for food
      * Became a great lubricant for factory machines
      * Palm oil became a cash crop using enslaved laborers to produce it
    * **Diamonds**
      * Starting in 1871, there was a **diamond rush** in South Africa
      * **Cecil Rhodes formed the DeBeers Mining Company, and because of his ambition in this area, South Africa was exporting 90% of the world’s diamonds by 1890**
      * Rhodes became very powerful and was elected to the South African Parliament
      * 1890 Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony
        * His racial policies led to the **apartheid**

  * Consequence 1: an increasingly interconnected global economy
    * Raw materials sold to imperial nations and imperial nations sold manufactured goods back to the colonies
      * Also began to import food from colonies to keep up with growing population, assisted by the invention of the refrigerator

  * Consequence 2: narrowing and weakening of the colonial economies
    * Large-scale shift to cash crop farming meant that the colonial people often grew cash crops at the expense of other agricultural necessities
